It doesn\u2019t matter whether you have set things in motion or you\u2019re about to. Taking some time off to reassess the frameworks of your current payment processing method is paramount because such payment solutions are vital in facilitating a boost in cross-border sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, then, begs the question. How do payment gateways help merchants accept an international payment and sell to consumers across borders? Is there a direct correlation between multiple payment gateways and increased cross-border sales? This post will answer these and more questions.

However, it would be best to understand there could be some more considerations for cross-border sales and payments. Here are some of them:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Customer purchase: There should be some form of localised checkout experience for cross-border sales. A good example is tailoring your checkout with the language of your shopper. It makes the customer feel more comfortable with their choice. A great payment gateway will sense the shopper\u2019s URL and tailor the cross-border transactions to suit the shopper, including the local currency. This is why you should consider infusing multiple payment gateways into your website to increase your scope of accepting an international payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Approval: This is when your bank either approves or rejects your payment request. This will depend on the availability of funds, transaction value and currency mismatch. If one of the payment methods can\u2019t handle any of this, customers should have the opportunity to try another to complete the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Routing and processing: When there are multiple payment gateways during cross-border transactions, it is more effective to complete a transaction as compared to a single gateway. It is also easier for a bank partner to a gateway to flag instances of fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment2.jpg\" alt=\"international payment\" class=\"wp-image-292\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"why-multiple-payment-gateways-are-important-in-cross-border-sales-success\"><\/span>Why multiple payment gateways are important in cross-border sales success<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as unique domestic payment methods are being established in different individual countries, there has been a steady growth of <a href=\"https:\/\/thepaypers.com\/interviews\/local-payment-methods-powering-growth-and-agility-in-the-wake-of-a-global-pandemic--1246001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">alternative payment solutions<\/a>, especially in the last few years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is as a result of the rapidly increasing cross-border transactions. Therefore, it is only wise for retailers to include multiple gateways that will attract more customers and retain the old ones. Many merchants lose customers and fail to manage a sale because of cart abandonment by international customers. Essentially, cart abandonment is when a customer leaves a shopping site without completing a transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It happens because customers don\u2019t find suitable checkout options. For example, a study indicated that in 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/resources\/shopping-cart-abandonment-statistics#:~:text=1.,documented%20ecommerce%20cart%20abandonment%20rate.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cart abandonment <\/a>was at 70%, but on adding alternative gateways and improving their customer experience, the conversion rates went up by 35%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-integrating-multiple-payment-gateways-translates-to-increased-sales\"><\/span>How integrating multiple payment gateways translates to increased sales<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a merchant integrates multiple gateways, it becomes easier for customers to complete their transactions rapidly and securely while staying responsible for authorising any payment. Furthermore, the assortment is why most international shoppers complete their payments because they offer more customisable options at the checkout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding cart abandonment is one ideal way of conversions. Also, when merchants leverage these alternative methods, they can collect and analyse shopper analytics that will help them make informed business decisions. At the same time, they offer insights on how best they can optimise their transactions to suit every niche.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is not only about integrating multiple gateways but also ensuring that there is efficiency, simplicity in navigation and transparency. Knowing the market is a fantastic way of helping merchants tailor the customers\u2019 checkout experience to fit their needs. When you do this, you easily drive your customer retention and engagement up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment3.jpg\" alt=\"international payment\" class=\"wp-image-293\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/international_payment3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-to-do-to-easily-receive-international-payment\"><\/span>What to do to easily receive international payment.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you integrate multiple gateways, you increase your chances of receiving an international payment by a great margin. Therefore, there are some things you should do to make this a success. Some of these things are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Include popular regional payment options: This will largely depend on the region you wish to operate in. If your region favours using cards, find the cheaper regional cards for your customers since sometimes universal cards could be more expensive. For example, if you target the Eastern Europe and Russia regions, you could integrate WebMoney\u2019s ewallet because it is extensively used in these parts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Adopt the local language: When you integrate a multilingual customer experience, you will likely boost customer loyalty. Customers feel more comfortable with their language when checking out. Some of the popular languages are English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic and Portuguese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Consider working with a local partner: You may be operating domestically and internationally, but you may fail to grasp the domestic intricacies. Therefore, when you work with a local partner, you will learn more about the social structure, culture, business customs, legislation, infrastructure, customer preferences and logistics. Knowing all these aspects will help offer greater exemptions or benefits to drive up sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When choosing multiple payment gateways to facilitate international payment acceptance; you have to ensure that it is simple and easy to use for everyone.
