Data from the National Retail Federation indicates that around <a href=\"https:\/\/nrf.com\/media-center\/press-releases\/coronavirus-leads-more-use-contactless-credit-cards-and-mobile-payments#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20Retail%20Payments,form%20of%20no-touch%20payment.&amp;text=Of%20those%2C%2062%20percent%20used,percent%20used%20a%20contactless%20card.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">67% of the US merchants<\/a> now accept contactless payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As payment trends go, contactless payments is perhaps the most recognisable. The increased adoption of NFC transactions by payment processors directly affects other industries such as near-field communication and EMV. They are the technologies that assist in powering the digital payment system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s expected that contactless cards, QR codes, and tap and go will continue to become more popular. Additionally, smart speakers and smartwatches that enable consumers to complete payments similarly will become more widespread.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Emphasis on Stronger Security to Support Digital Payment Technologies<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Extra emphasis will go towards boosting the security of online payment systems. As digital payment trends go, many, if not all, of them rely on the internet to work. Considering that everything based on the web remains prone to cyber-attacks, payments solution companies will need to improve their cybersecurity frameworks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing better security measures to help safeguard online financial transactions will allow AI and machine learning-powered systems to take the lead. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/jwq192l90qn3r7y8a310mlpv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/digital-payment-trends-statistics2.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TCS<\/a>, 44% of payment processing companies already use these measures to prevent security lapses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the customer authentication process may necessitate the inclusion of additional security layers to help protect online bank accounts. Additional security layers can include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Voice-enabled payments<\/strong><br>\u2022 <strong>Facial recognition<\/strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Biometric-enabled payments<\/strong> <\/a>for example, offer additional security to both business and personal account holders. It\u2019s a near-instant and seamless experience that helps to guarantee the clients\u2019 peace of mind while expediting the transaction speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Integrated Payments to Support Seamless Checkout for Clients<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, a clear distinction existed between merchants, the central bank, and financial service providers. Today, all the merchants have made steps to integrate online payments and payment processing, on their ecommerce platforms.<br>Integrated payments form a crucial part of the digital payment trends as they ensure that customers enjoy a seamless checkout and payment process. It means that payments have now become a part of the trade instead of remaining an independent entity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merchants want to avoid adding extra steps to the process, so they have resorted to using open APIs to interact with the clients\u2019 bank accounts. The payment initiation services enable them to interact with other processors and execute transactions with ease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>The Redefinition of B2B Payments<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>While the digital payment trends have all helped benefit advances in the payments industry and the FinTech industry, the B2B payments have not benefited as expected. The digital payments industry has forgotten about the contributions made by those in the B2B sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People in this sector have access to global financial services, and the presence of a fracture in the B2B experience can easily lead to chaos. As such, there\u2019s a need for payment solution providers to offer the same level of speed, security, and quality to B2B payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the end of the year, the sector can expect to notice a greater focus on speed, customization, and personalization in B2B. The benefits of digital payments will become more apparent as the need for them continues to increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend2.jpg\" alt=\"payment trends\" class=\"wp-image-263\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>Continued Evolution of P2P Payments<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The audience for peer-to-peer payments has slowly broadened in the past year to include the older generation. In the past, the industry mainly catered to the needs of the tech-savvy millennials, a factor that has changed since the onset of the global pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Platforms such as Razorpay and PayPal have become more popular and continue to notice a surge in their daily financial transaction volumes. Going forward, the next step may involve offering additional services and attempting to increase their annual revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many platforms already offer extra services such as debit card offerings, crypto transactions, and investment and trading services. These are services that were previously only offered by the banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the business opportunity continues to increase, this is a trend that may transcend across numerous platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\"><li><strong>Rise of Embedded Payments and eCommerce Transactions<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail eCommerce sales in the United States peaked during the lockdown as more people opted to shop online instead of conducting in-store shopping. By the end of last year, consumers spent around $794.5 billion shopping online, representing an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalcommerce360.com\/article\/us-ecommerce-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increase of 32.4% from 2019<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retailers, including businesses that had never sold goods online before, were forced to ramp up their online presence amid nationwide store closures. Although in-store will resume once the pandemic subsides, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/content\/payments-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Insider Intelligence<\/a> reports that the events of last year and early this year helped to accelerate a shift to ecommerce by at least two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the coming days, eCommerce sales will account for $1 out of every $5 spent by consumers on retails as customers try to sustain the shopping habits formed during the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend3.jpg\" alt=\"payment trends\" class=\"wp-image-264\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_trend3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital payments including biometric and contactless payments are the future. The sector will notice a surge as merchants transition from physical cash to online payment systems in the coming months. During this time, many digital payment trends will come and go, but they will all help in shaping the payments industry.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The rapidly changing technological landscape, economic, political, and social conditions have helped the payment processing sector undergo a real revolution.
