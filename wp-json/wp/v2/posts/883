The most important thing is usually to have the prepaid debit card institution sign on it. You can\u2019t just go to the card network, get a merchant number, and start accepting credit cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bank has to decide if you\u2019re creditworthy, which means that they have to decide whether to trust you. If you\u2019re a small business with no track record, they might not want to lend you anything. They might want you to prepay some amount of money against future sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit card institutions like to work with already established businesses, but this does not mean that your business transaction won\u2019t be effective as a startup company. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Verv<\/a> is here to assist all companies that need support and friendly fees to provide their services.

class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fintechna.com\/press-releases\/defi-project-kingswap-launches-visa-debit-card-globally\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visa debit card<\/a> is the most common, and many businesses and individuals hold Visa credit card. But if you want to select other options, you are free to do so as there are others like American Express and MasterCard. These two are also internationally used. Apart from that, credit unions and banks around you can sponsor you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The debit card processors provide reliable payment options and the right amount of security needed to allow your customers to make transactions stress-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-2-get-a-simple-design-for-your-debit-card\"><\/span>Step 2: Get a Simple Design for Your Debit Card<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like business cards, you can also design your own debit card. Today, it is easy to do that, thanks to the high-tech and easy-to-use online websites that offer brilliant images. You do not have to make complicated designs for your debit card. A simple image representing your company will do. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the Stripe debit card has its business logo on the front part and, on the other side, a few details about the cardholder. Whichever design your select, ensure the card is presentable. The images and colours you select should match your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-3-have-a-fee-structure\"><\/span>Step 3: Have a Fee Structure<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have your company\u2019s debit card, you must make it easier for customers to use the card. Be it a virtual credit card or a physical one, the fee structure of your company should be well defined. Remember, you will be making money from the services you provide based on the charges you have presented to your customer. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure you research the required or standard fees you should charge. If the credit card fees are high, many customers will shift to cards that offer affordable fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-4-include-the-terms-and-conditions\"><\/span>Step 4: Include the Terms and Conditio<strong>ns<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you create your own debit card company, do not forget to include the terms and conditions to allow customers to understand how transactions occur in the company. This will provide your customers with the trust they need. Some of the things to include in the terms and conditions sections are;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Annual fee<\/li><li>Transaction fee<\/li><li>Balance transfer<\/li><li>Minimum interest charge<\/li><li>Annual percentage rate, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure to include anything that you feel is important for the customers to know in regards to the payment policy of the company. This not only allows you and your customers to meet at a common ground. It also prevents future conflicts from arising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-5-start-marketing-your-cards\"><\/span>Step 5: Start Marketing Your Cards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is usually the most challenging step as your mission is to get the cards in the customer\u2019s wallet. It is not as easy as it may seem. You need a good strategy to encourage your customers to use your company\u2019s debit card. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important not to flood the cards in the market because many people might reject them. Instead, you can provide a free debit card to anyone who wants your services. Apart from that, you can hire freelance marketers to spread your company\u2019s message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-6-get-a-private-label-relationship\"><\/span>Step 6: Get a Private Label Relationship<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most businesses that run their own debit card always find it to be costly. Luckily, you can partner with private label debit card companies to ease the burden on your startup. This will help save money, and the good thing is that the card will still hold your business logo. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides that, monthly fees and long-term commitments will be lifted off your shoulders as you focus on growing your business. Lastly, register your business to companies that will help you manage business assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-to-ensure-you-get-approved-for-a-payment-card\"><\/span>How to Ensure You Get Approved for a Payment Card<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting your own payment card can sometimes be challenging as a few things need to be polished to qualify for the card. The good news is that you can always improve your chances of getting approved by doing the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ensure-your-company-has-a-good-credit-score\"><\/span>Ensure Your Company Has a Good Credit Score<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Assume that you are going to borrow a loan from the bank. The first thing they will check is your credit score. This is to affirm that you will manage to pay the loan when the due date arrives. It is the same as applying for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/credit-cards\/best\/business-cards-for-startups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business debit card<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any bank or sponsors you will be partnering with want to ensure that your business can sustain the debit cards while driving profits to your organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"clear-all-your-debts\"><\/span>Clear All your Debts<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is crucial to pay all your debts to have a good relationship with the bank. This will make it easier for the bank to sponsor you. Remember, it is all about creating trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"importance-of-having-your-companys-debit-card\"><\/span>Importance of Having Your Company\u2019s Debit Card.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make your business grow, you need to be able to accept credit cards from your customers. Customers love the convenience of being able to pay with their cards. So why not take advantage of this? Here are some reasons why you should get a debit card for your business:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It is easy to use. You can just swipe the customer\u2019s card and enter the amount you will charge them for their purchase.<\/li><li>It is fast and convenient for both you and your customers. This means that they will be able to make their purchases in less time, which means more money for you!<\/li><li>Another reason why it\u2019s important is that if there is an issue with a payment made by debit or credit card, it can easily be resolved without having to go through all of the hassle involved in dealing with banks and other financial institutions that normally handle such issues.<\/li><li>It also gives consumers peace of mind knowing that their personal information will never be leaked<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"business-debit-cards-are-they-worth-the-hassle\"><\/span>Business Debit Cards: Are They Worth the Hassle?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Debit cards eliminate the need to carry cash or physical checks to make purchases. This makes them outstanding, fun, and easy to use, but are you really prepared for the annual and management fees that come with having your own company\u2019s payment card. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, do not worry because Verv offers an entire payment ecosystem to let your business grow. It allows you to have a business and personal account, and the fees are very affordable, which is suitable for small businesses. But all in all, you can still design your own debit card to generate more customers for the business. It is worth the hassle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every bank offers them today, but what&#8217;s interesting is that they aren&#8217;t just linked to banks anymore.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":885,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16,14],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/883"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=883"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/883\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":887,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/883\/revisions\/887"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/885"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=883"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=883"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=883"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
