During this period, clay tablets people in Mesopotamia used clay tablets that served as money. Later in the 19th century, lenders and financial stores developed metal credit tokens and charge plates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the first payment credit card invented arrived in 1950 after Frank McNamara and Ralph Schneider discovered the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/credit-cards\/what-is-a-diners-club-card\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dinners club card<\/a>. This card was designed to pay bills at hotels and restaurants. However, it extended its services to meet other requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1953, it was the first internationally accepted payment card in most countries such as Canada, Mexico, USA, and United Kingdom. In 1958, the Bank of America launched the first modern credit card that gave the holder a 500-dollar limit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the invention of the first generation card, several companies, such as American Express, developed travel and entertainment cards. Forest Parry, an engineer at IBM, invented the magnetic strip, which initiated the development of the Air Travelcard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 1970, the BankAmericard became an interbank card association whose role was to issue and manage credit cards. The company later changed its name to Visa in 1976. Later the Interbank card association rebranded the Master Charge to Mastercard in 1968.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From 1980 to 2000, credit and debit card technology never saw any progressive change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-are-the-benefits-of-payment-cards\"><\/span>What are the Benefits of Payment cards?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Debit and credit cards offer a high level of convenience. The Buy now Pay later is one of the main benefits of paying with a credit card. It allows you to make big purchases on credit, which you can pay later through small EMIs. These cards are more convenient as they offer an easy way to pay rather than carrying loads of cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Card payment is also one of the highly accepted payment modes. All cardholders can facilitate payment from anywhere and enjoy the benefits of the card. Paying using credit cards also earns you travel points.<br>Credit cards also come in handy during emergencies and contribute positively to your overall credit score.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-caused-the-change-from-physical-to-digital-cards\"><\/span>What Caused the Change from Physical to Digital Cards?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-verv-is-changing-the-way-we-pay-640x427-1.jpg\" alt=\"the way we pay is about to change\" class=\"wp-image-912\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-verv-is-changing-the-way-we-pay-640x427-1.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/how-verv-is-changing-the-way-we-pay-640x427-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Debit and credit cards have existed for more than 70 years. These cards are now shifting from physical o digital credit cards. Online financial institutions such as Verv now offer <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/making-international-and-domestic-payments\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"722\">digital payment cards<\/a> to their clients. A credit innovation such as digital cards has seen debit cards increasing due to the convenience it offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Covid 19 pandemic also brought the need to develop contactless cards as people tried to limit contact. However, the usage of digital cards may decline due to the need to have a stable internet connection and transmission issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An increase in eCommerce platforms also created the need for contactless cards. Before, people used to store their credit card information on the phone. However, with the increasing online transactions, digital cards offer more service than traditional physical cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online transactions are growing faster than face-to-face transactions, and newer payment options offered by Verv are becoming more prominent. These innovations may have a direct implication for the banking industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-are-the-trends-signal-an-ominous-future-for-credit-cards\"><\/span>What are the Trends Signal an Ominous Future for Credit Cards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Technological advancement has led to a shift in payment methods. Most payments are being replaced with the introduction of newer technological payment methods. A good example is the use of cheques to make payments. In the previous years, cheques were very common. Currently, it isn&#8217;t easy to witness anyone making payments with cheques.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifting to digital cards poses a threat to physical payment. The customer support system for physical cards was substandard. People had to wait for long hours to get their issues addressed. However, with the incoming of digital banks such as Verv, digital card owners can receive instant help through the live chat support system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of artificial intelligence with digital cards also provides regular payment reminders making it easy to track transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is the future of credit and debit card payments? It is difficult to imagine what will replace credit cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of credit cards is difficult to determine as advanced financial institutions such as Verv are developing newer payment technologies. Therefore, if these cards survive, companies should develop innovative debit card products and credit card innovations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-changes-in-card-usage\"><\/span>1. Changes in Card Usage<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The management features added to the mobile applications will affect the usage of debit and credit cards. Card owners can now facilitate payment using their phones. This credit card innovation brings more flexibility to the use of the card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cardholders can now have complete control of their accounts, such as changing the PIN, controlling spending behaviour, and restricting the use of a card. Since it is a new technological innovation, the Verv Company offers some modern credit card products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers can now apply for an online digital card and <a href=\"https:\/\/n26.com\/en-eu\/contactless-card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">perform contactless payments<\/a> through their phones. The company aims to provide the most secure payment channels using different methods, such as the use of biometrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/firstatlanticcommerce.com\/blog\/4-ways-ai-is-changing-the-present-and-future-of-payment-processing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Integrating AI systems<\/a> will help facilitate easy payment for goods and services. These AI systems represent a potential opportunity in the card market since large social media platforms are adopting bot-powered payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-the-feel-and-look-factor\"><\/span>2. The Feel and Look Factor<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Future cards will offer more convenience in terms of security and fraud protection. Security is an essential factor to address since fraudsters get creative each day. During the covid 19 pandemic, more than 34.5 billion dollars was lost through cyber fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market analysts believe that physical payment cards will diminish due to a lack of sustainability. The main reason for the plastic is to hose the ENV chip that facilitates payments on POS terminals. Companies such as Verv will employ Radio Frequency Identification chips that can be included in most wearable items such as rings. This move will allow people to reduce the need to carry cards when purchasing items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-changes-in-the-banking-systems\"><\/span>3. Changes in the Banking Systems<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Debit and credit card companies will have to change their operational patterns to accommodate any future changes in card usage. Payment companies will also need to provide more streamlined payment options to offer customized experiences to customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using these techniques, companies can obtain customer information and provide updates about new products in the market. Shared data also enables lending companies to determine the payment ability when giving out loans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"parting-shot-on-future-of-credit-card\"><\/span>Parting Shot on Future of Credit Card<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital cards are almost similar to old plastic cards. These cards also contain the sixteen-digit card number, CVV and expiry date. However, they offer a more secure payment option compared to physical cards. In the future, it&#8217;s expected that there will be a debit card that shows balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/radiation-emitting-products\/electromagnetic-compatibility-emc\/radio-frequency-identification-rfid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Radio Frequency Technology<\/a> is one of the main reasons for the increased use of digital cards. It operates similar to Bluetooth hence facilitating contactless transactions. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\">Verv<\/a> is one of the leading online financial institutions that offers a variety of business payment methods.
