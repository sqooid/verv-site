A digital payment solution refers to a system that facilitates online payments between payer and payee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of an online payment eliminates the need to exchange physical cash between two or multiple parties. Additionally, it makes it easier to transfer digital currency using mobile technologies from one account to another.<br>All this has become a possibility thanks to the adoption of mobile payment technologies by the payments industry. Typical payment technologies include mobile payment apps and mobile wallets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-is-a-payment-processing-solution-for-a-business\"><\/span>What Is a Payment Processing Solution for A Business?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever customers buy goods or services using an online payment method, e.g., credit\/debit card, the financial transaction is handled by a payment processor on behalf of the business. The payment processing company does this by:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Relaying details of this transaction to the customer\u2019s and business\u2019s bank accounts<br>\u2022 Verifying whether that particular transaction is valid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply; payment processors serve as a bridge between the financial services providers, the buyers, online payment methods, and the sellers. Their job is to simplify the entire experience for all the involved parties. Examples of a modern payment solution include Amazon Pay, Paypal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1.jpg\" alt=\"payment solution\" class=\"wp-image-267\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-do-payment-solutions-work\"><\/span>How Do Payment Solutions Work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Use of online payment methods has helped simplify transactions and enabled the world to <a href=\"https:\/\/bellafricana.com\/world-global-village\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">become a global village.<\/a> Unlike cash transactions, there are usually tons of activities occurring behind the scenes when using digital payments methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a buyer has selected their preferred payment solution, the bank and payment processors immediately initiate a series of actions and notifications.
