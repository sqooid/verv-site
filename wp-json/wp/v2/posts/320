It could be because the new payment gateway offers enhanced reporting, improved security, better approval ratios, or quicker funding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever reasons trigger the payment gateway migration, you have to keep in mind that the process can be quite tasking. From mapping out the migration project, managing the transition, and considering the possible impacts, it may have on customer satisfaction or your business. Here, you will get better insights on what could lead to migration and everything else you need to know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"key-considerations-before-migrating-to-another-payment-gateway\"><\/span>Key considerations before migrating to another payment gateway<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some crucial factors that you should keep in mind before you proceed with transition. These are some of the key ones:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Your current payment gateway setup<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The technicalities of online payment scope will largely be determined by your current payment gateway setup. It will all trickle down to how you accept payments. For instance, if you are using a virtual terminal, you will only get a new merchant identification number together with a link including instructions for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncr.com\/company\/blogs\/financial\/how-to-navigate-a-migration-to-a-modern-payment-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">migration<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the current financial services setup is a little bit more complicated, utilizing third-party API, you may find it effortless to migrate. Still, you will have to inform the third parties in the new project plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>The current business needs<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The level your business is at now may not be the same as compared to when it started. The payment processors that were available at the time may not entirely cope with your business evolution. However, to ensure that you make the appropriate decision and use of payment reporting and innovation options, these questions could prove crucial:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Could a <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/business-account\/#:~:text=Stop%20losing%20customers%20on%20the%20checkout%20page.%20Verv%E2%80%99s%20ready%2Dto%2Duse%2C%20customisable%20checkout%20page%20is%20designed%20to%20turn%20anyone%20that%20lands%20on%20it%20to%20a%20paying%20customer.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">broader payments solution<\/a> be instrumental in growing your market share?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 What are the volumes looking like? Do you plan to go international?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Looking at the financial transaction data and reports, do you feel like you need to set up support analytics?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These questions will be vital in defining the optimal use case to ensure that this implementation will be in tandem with your business objectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>When do you wish to complete the migration?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This will come down to the available resources, your implementation plan, and how devoted you are to this migration. These factors will decide whether it takes one month or even stretch to four months. It would be best if you came up with a time frame for ending your current<a href=\"https:\/\/help.muvi.com\/help\/monetization\/migrating-payment-gateway.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> payment gateway relationship.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, to ensure that there is payment continuity during the migration, it would be best to keep the current platform running in parallel with the new one simultaneously. The best time to continue this is about 180 days to give time to complete any pending issues. Ensure that you retain all of the records just in case you need to audit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/checklist-for-migrating-a-payment-gateway.jpg\" alt=\"payment gateway\" class=\"wp-image-393\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/checklist-for-migrating-a-payment-gateway.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/checklist-for-migrating-a-payment-gateway-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/checklist-for-migrating-a-payment-gateway-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-checklist-for-migrating-to-a-new-platform\"><\/span>The checklist for migrating to a new platform<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you map out how you want to transition to the new online payment platform, it would be relatively easy to complete the process. Ensure that you check in after each task to ensure that process is smooth without disrupting your business. Therefore, here is a checklist to help you in that regard:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 The identification, engagement, and keeping stakeholders in the loop: Before you migrate, you need to understand that involving stakeholders is pretty vital. It could include the peer community to the executive leadership. Ensure that they are in the loop to ensure that there is minimal impact on the migration timeline. Furthermore, ensure that there are routine updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Put together the right team: Involve all the crucial departments leaders like the VP of finance or CFO to ensure that the tools used are suitable for meeting all the project needs from the beginning. You may also want to include an experienced developer from IT. Novices will most likely slow things down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Ensure proper allocation of budget and time: Even before the migration starts, ensure you properly allocate hours and funds, including a dedicated staff to ensure the entire timeline remains intact to the end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Come up with a timeline: You need to develop a timeline, which will identify each project milestone, including analysis and coding to testing and certification. At the same time, you need to ensure that there is time for regular update meetings involving every task owner to review the timelines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Regularly review the continuity plan: Always factor in the fact that at some point, there will be some form of business disruption. Therefore, ensure that there are contingencies to affirm that there is internal support to ease things out while devising plans to cover potential glitches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Ensure there is a plan to test all through the process: Testing is a vital process in any form of implementation to ensure there is seamless integration. Testing as you sail through the process is important to ensure that you allocate the required resources, especially at the time you want to go live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what you need to know before you choose to migrate to another payment gateway.
