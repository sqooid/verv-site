However, someone who is looking to make payments for the first time may not quite understand what sets domestic and international payments apart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that these two modes of payment are in some ways similar. One of the similarities is that both of them relay transaction information over some sort of secure network to deliver the funds to the recipient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not the similarities that count but rather the differences. Therefore, this post covers everything that sets these financial services apart. Read on to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"domestic-payments-what-are-they\"><\/span>Domestic payments: What are they?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different banks use different methods to facilitate domestic payments. For instance, the US, banks utilize CHIPS (Clearing House Interbank Payments System) or Fedwire to effect local transactions in the local payments industry. Essentially, domestic payments are all payments made within the national borders of a country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, payment processing for domestic payments is done within one business day when the systems finally clears the books for the day. This is done in accordance with the laws and regulations of the central bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-are-international-payments\"><\/span>What are international payments?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where local banks effect wire transfers to an international receiving bank. Instead of the local payments solution routing the numbers to a local digital payment system, it will transmit the instructions through services like Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) codes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, domestic transfers are typically processed within the same business day. However, for international payments, a standard transfer may take up to two business days for funds to reflect in the recipient\u2019s account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference in the times is mostly as a result of engaging with foreign payment processors rather than the Automated Clearing Houses (ACH). Since domestic transfers only go through a local ACH, it only takes a day to complete. For international transfers, it also has to pass via the country\u2019s ACH, adding another day to the processing time. Further hindrances that may cause delays include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Weekends<br>\u2022 Bank holidays<br>\u2022 Time zones<br>\u2022 Detail errors<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/keep-in-mind-for-international-payments-1.jpg\" alt=\"international payments\" class=\"wp-image-582\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/keep-in-mind-for-international-payments-1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/keep-in-mind-for-international-payments-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/keep-in-mind-for-international-payments-1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"key-differences-between-domestic-and-international-payments\"><\/span>Key differences between domestic and international payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have an understanding of what domestic and international payments are, it is time to look at some of the key <a href=\"https:\/\/keydifferences.com\/difference-between-domestic-and-international-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">differences between these two<\/a> form of payments. Some of them are as below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>The risk of challenges<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When processing a domestic payment, authorities are less likely to scrutinize that transaction. This is primarily because of both of the parties involved are subjected to pretty much the same regulations and compliance, especially when it comes to the issue of taxation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For international payments on the other hand, authorities may scrutinize the transactions, sometimes even place holds if they detect any case of fraudulent financial transaction. Also, these two parties to this transaction are not subject to the same regulations, hence may end up causing delays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Compliance<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For domestic transfers, there may not be much when it comes to compliance because the rules are pretty much the same for these financial services. However, it may not be the same case for international payments. For instance, some compliance requirements like transfer pricing documentation and tax filings may come into place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Withholding taxes<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, domestic digital payments transfer do not attract withholding taxes unlike for international payments. This is mostly based on the domestic legislation, which could be in terms of services fees, dividends, royalty fees of interest payments on online payment in the payments industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Transfer costs<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether you want to make local or international payments, there are some associated fees that you must incur. It is generally cheaper for domestic transfers than it is for international transfers because of the additional fees like currency conversion and intermediary bank fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, it is only customary for the receiver and sender of the digital payments to split the transaction costs. In general sense, the sender will cater for any local bank charges while the recipient will cover the receiving bank and intermediary bank charges in the payments industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"some-special-considerations-to-keep-in-mind\"><\/span>Some special considerations to keep in mind<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>US transfer requirements<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want to make domestic or international transfer in the US, you may have to produce your proof or residence and photo I.D. If it\u2019s a business, articles of incorporation may come in handy. This ensures that there are no anonymous transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already have an existing bank account, a domestic transfer may be as easy as ABC, whether online or at your local branch. However, there may be some extra requirements for amounts exceeding some set threshold. It may be more stringent for international payments, especially if the transfer is made to a non-account holder or a receiver in a safe-haven country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EU transfer requirements<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the EU, all the domestic transfers are processed using BIC (Bank Identification Code) or SWIFT code. On the international front, the IBAN (International Bank Association Number) is important in the identification of the recipient\u2019s bank. Banks in the EU have to adhere to any set regulations by SEPA to ensure that <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cross border payments <\/a>are seamless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch transactions happen within and across borders, no physical cash is used while doing the exchanges.
