Most modern consumers use credit cards to help them achieve this goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though convenient, credit cards can prove problematic if you run up a bill or choose to make minimum payments. You need to find a way to balance your usage and monthly debt repayments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A failure to do so may cause you to accumulate a large debt forcing collectors to come after you.

They ensure you don\u2019t have to visit a bank to make a purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people\/entities have to take part in the transaction. In this case, you\u2019ll have:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A consumer\/customer who hands over their credit card to make a payment<\/li><li>The eCommerce store owner selling the goods or services<\/li><li>A merchant bank tasked with sending the credit card payments for approval<\/li><li>The online credit card network that serves as a liaison between the card issuer and the merchant bank<\/li><li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/business\/software\/best-credit-card-processing-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">credit card issuer<\/a> gets to approve the transaction request and release the funds due<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/guide-to-credit-card-payments.jpg\" alt=\"your guide to credit card payments\" class=\"wp-image-797\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/guide-to-credit-card-payments.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/guide-to-credit-card-payments-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/guide-to-credit-card-payments-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"credit-card-payments-a-guide-on-credit-card-payments\"><\/span>Credit Card Payments \u2013 A Guide on Credit Card Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-1-swipe-the-online-credit-card-for-approval\"><\/span>Step 1: Swipe the Online credit card for Approval<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The consumer will need to present the credit card to a merchant for payment, who will then swipe it into an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/nextavenue\/2015\/12\/21\/6-things-to-know-about-emv-chip-credit-cards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EMV card reader<\/a>. Other payment options may include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Swiping its magnetic stripe<\/li><li>Tapping the credit card on a contactless payment terminal<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When either of these actions occurs, the terminal transmits a request to the merchant bank to check whether the card has enough funds. Most cards today use microchip technology. The cards have an embedded microchip containing the cardholder\u2019s information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-2-credit-card-payments-clearing-payments\"><\/span>Step 2: Credit Card Payments \u2013 Clearing Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once it has received the request, the merchant bank contacts the correct card network and authorizes the purchase. From here, the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/online-purchases-how-to-stay-safe-on-the-web\/#:~:text=add%20the%20best-,payments,-solution%20to%20their\">payment network<\/a> communicates with the card issuer to confirm two things:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The card making this purchase isn\u2019t invalid<\/li><li>It has enough credit to complete the payment<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The issuer will check these two things before transmitting its response. If the transaction doesn\u2019t get approved, the eCommerce merchant won\u2019t give you a reason. They\u2019ll merely inform you that the transaction has failed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must contact the issuer to establish why the card failed. The bank serving the eCommerce store will send its communications electronically, either through the internet or via a phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-3-online-credit-card-payments-approval-process\"><\/span>Step 3: Online Credit Card Payments Approval Process<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The approval message for the credit card payment will come from the merchant bank. After it has arrived, the terminal will print a receipt that you\u2019ll need to sign before having your goods shipped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A merchant will not need to get your signature if you opt to use the EMV chip in your card. Although you\u2019ll get to leave the store with your goods, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the merchant has received the payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It only means that the issuer has <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/domestic-vs-international-payments-differences\/#:~:text=Today%2C-,digital%20payments,-have%20made%20it\">authorized the digital payments<\/a>. If you check your balance online, you\u2019ll notice that the issuer may have recorded that transaction as an authorized transaction. Your available credit will also have reduced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-4-credit-card-payments-batch-processing\"><\/span>Step 4: Credit Card Payments \u2013 Batch Processing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, the merchant will need to send a batched list of all the credit card payments that have occurred that day to the bank. However, you should note that there are merchants who prefer to settle transactions on a real-time basis as they get approved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such merchants don\u2019t participate in batch processing. The merchant bank will then need to send all batched transactions to the pre-determined payment network to get processed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-5-online-credit-card-issuers-releases-the-payments\"><\/span>Step 5: Online Credit Card Issuers Releases the Payment(s)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The credit network must inform the issuers of all the due expenses. The card issuer gets paid a small fee known as the interchange fee for facilitating the transaction. All this is part of the agreement they signed with the merchant and helps cover their risk and processing fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banking as a service platform charges an assessment fee to grant access to the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-6-the-ecommerce-merchant-receives-the-payment-made-earlier\"><\/span>Step 6: The eCommerce Merchant Receives the Payment Made Earlier<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step, the merchant bank receives the payment sent by the credit card network. It deducts a small percentage for its role in this transaction before depositing the remainder into its client\u2019s account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"step-7-credit-card-explained-you-get-billed-by-the-credit-card-issuer\"><\/span>Step 7: Credit Card Explained \u2013 You Get Billed by the Credit Card Issuer<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer billing is the last step in the credit card payments process. The card issuer gets to send you a monthly bill highlighting all your expenses. Once you have received the bill, you\u2019ll need to pay all or a percentage of these charges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that the issuer will charge you interest if you fail to clear the entire debt. Card issuers typically use the interest earned and the remaining card balance to pay off merchants as new transactions get processed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"everything-you-need-to-know-about-credit-cards-before-applying-for-one\"><\/span>Everything You Need to Know About Credit Cards Before Applying for One<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, access to a credit card can significantly simplify your life. But there are a few things you ought to know before you rush online to research issuers and even apply for one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Most issuers only approve cards to applicants aged 18, though some only issue to those above 21<\/li><li>If possible, avoid making a cash withdrawal from your card. Such transactions will typically attract higher processing fees plus interest. The interest will begin to accumulate from the date of withdrawal.<\/li><li>You have to ensure you make a payment every month. Even during the interest-free days, missing a payment will make the issuer include new charges. It could also cause the loss of the introductory rate before damaging your current rating.<\/li><li>Credit card companies can perform two types of checks:<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>o A hard check: It involves going through your credit file.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>o A soft check: It will not impact your rating in any way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"should-you-get-a-credit-card\"><\/span>Should You Get a Credit Card?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As convenient as they are, credit cards aren\u2019t ideal for every person. Individuals who constantly overspend or have a hard time managing money are better off without a credit card. Such individuals should do everything possible to ensure they don\u2019t apply for one<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you\u2019re confident of your ability to manage your money and are sure that you can make monthly credit card payments, there\u2019s no reason not to get one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"are-there-benefits-of-getting-an-online-credit-card\"><\/span>Are there Benefits of Getting an Online Credit Card?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Easy to use: These cards are accepted in almost all eCommerce stores and have a higher acceptance rate than prepaid or charge cards.<\/li><li>You\u2019re protected: As a consumer, you\u2019re protected under federal laws for purchases over $100 and less than $30,000. It means that if you booked a holiday today and the service provider went out of business, the issuer should cover your costs.<\/li><li>It\u2019s a cheaper way to borrow: Cards are a better way to borrow for people who make monthly payments. Most issuers offer their consumers an interest-free period.<\/li><li>Safer than carrying cash around: If the card gets lost or misplaced, all you need to do is place a call to the bank and have it canceled.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Learning how an online credit card works, how to get one, and its benefits can significantly enhance your life.
