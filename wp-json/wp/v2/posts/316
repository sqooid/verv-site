The payment gateway could be:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Online wallet<br>\u2022 Gift card<br>\u2022 Debit card<br>\u2022 Credit card<br>\u2022 Bank account<br>When you choose the best digital payments gateway for your business, it becomes relatively easy to not only process any digital payment but also to accept. They help avoid all the hassle of setting up connections, hardware, and other components just to accept and process payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/effortless-payment-gateway-checkout-on-all-devices.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1058\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/effortless-payment-gateway-checkout-on-all-devices.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/effortless-payment-gateway-checkout-on-all-devices-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/effortless-payment-gateway-checkout-on-all-devices-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"questions-to-ask-before-choosing-payment-gateways\"><\/span>Questions to ask before choosing payment gateways<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses needing payment gateways, it is imperative that they ask themselves the following questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 What are the available features they offer? Including virtual terminals and fraud security<br>\u2022 Does the preferred payment gateway support the country\u2019s online stores?<br>\u2022 What will be running costs?<br>\u2022 Will it be compulsory to have a merchant account for the preferred payment gateway?<br>Important considerations when choosing a payment gateway<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before a merchant embarks on the decision to settle for anyone particular payment gateway, depending on a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netsolutions.com\/insights\/business-and-functional-requirements-what-is-the-difference-and-why-should-you-care\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">functional and business requirements<\/a>, here are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.computer.org\/publications\/tech-news\/trends\/7-pivotal-things-to-consider-while-choosing-your-payment-gateway-provider\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">factors to keep in mind<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Find an appropriate payment gateway flow<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As an online business continues to grow, you should find payment gateways that flow with it. Therefore, businesses must choose the best payment flow when adding a gateway to their website. A few things to consider are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Ensuring that you are running a site with an integrated payment gateway form that can send payment information through a secure gateway.<br>\u2022 Redirect or iframe for payments: This means that customers will either be redirected to a more secure, hosted payment page or input their information in the form of embedded iFrame on the site.<br>\u2022 Ensure that there is an integrated escrow system: There are some certain businesses that require escrow systems integrated within their platforms. They work best for businesses that work as intermediaries to ensure that funds are securely stored until the deal comes to an end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Choose the right product<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the type of product or service you sell on your platform, you must have a payment gateway. Even as you sell your product or service, you should ensure that it is the right one by considering how adaptable your preferred payment solution is but ensuring you don\u2019t tamper with security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Ensure that your clients feel safe and secure<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wish to take your business to the next level, you should aim at meeting customer expectations in tandem with other succeeding platforms. Inasmuch as you might be running a small business, customers still expect a high-performing website, which means better payment gateway services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, to ensure that customers continue feeling safe and secure while shopping on your website, aim to customize the entire payment experience to suit your business\u2019s typeface, color palette, and logo. This includes ensuring that the provider is certified by standards like PCI-DSS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>How about the service agreement requirements and fees?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, payment gateways price their services depending on the kind of transactions a business carries out, including revenue consistency, market served, business sales, and transaction frequency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, businesses should endeavor to consider how their business model coincides with the fee structure of the payment processor. Some may require contracts and setup fees, while others may charge processing fees if the threshold isn\u2019t met.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-is-a-payment-gateway.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1080\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-is-a-payment-gateway.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-is-a-payment-gateway-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/what-is-a-payment-gateway-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>5. <strong>Ensuring that the checkout is effortless on all devices<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About<a href=\"https:\/\/www.simicart.com\/blog\/m-commerce-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> 79% of smartphone<\/a> users have performed online purchases using their phones in 2021. At the same time, these figures continue to soar steadily. Therefore, even as you evaluate the payment provider that will suit your business, ensure that it comes with an adaptable checkout experience, optimized for all kinds of network types and devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <strong>Includes effortless integration process<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as the integration of solid payment gateways into a business website isn\u2019t a DIY process, the best providers offer detailed integration instructions to their clients to make it relatively easy for them to integrate by themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, businesses must find a solution that doesn\u2019t interfere with their website\u2019s UX with a rather slow payment process. Therefore, ensure that you select a payment provider that is both beneficial and easy for customers to complete their payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding an ideal payment gateway and integrating it into your business isn\u2019t a DIY process.
