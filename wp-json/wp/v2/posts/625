They do this by building on the APIs provided by banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model allows Fintech companies to build new products on existing banking infrastructure. Without it, it would not be possible to offer the said services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, companies need a license to offer banking services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a company looking to boost its business revenue by providing deposit and loan services will need:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Pre-paid instrument license: It is a license you must have to issue pre-paid cards<br>\u2022 NBFC license: A license for offering loans and lending assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As things stand, licenses are pretty hard to obtain.

Thanks to this integration, they can now begin to facilitate digital payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonbanks like this model as it allows them to boost business revenue without going through the motions of acquiring a banking license.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how does it work? And who are the players involved?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"players-involved-in-baas\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"players-involved-in-baas\"><\/span>Players Involved in Baas<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It generally involves three chief players:<br><br><strong>1. The Bank: New-Age or Traditional Bank<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are responsible for providing the infrastructure as a service layer (IaaS). It comprises physical infrastructure services, e.g., communication and server hardware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks possess the licenses required to offer banking services. Through this model, they get to open up their banking systems to third-party providers.<br><br><strong>2. Banking as a Service Platform<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform offers the software needed to ensure safe data transmission between the fintech company and the bank. It\u2019s a layer known as the middle layer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies supporting <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">digital payments and payment<\/a> processing link into the platform like Lego. The platform is purely API-based and serves as a back-end for nonbanks.<br><br><strong>3. Fintech Startups and Nonbanks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the companies that interact with the consumers. They also serve as the platform\u2019s primary customers.<br>Please note that the companies in this category can be fintech on non-fintech. They only need to be interested in connecting their products to these financial services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies need to comply with the existing regulations to plug into the platform. Non-compliance means they cannot facilitate digital payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-banking-as-a-service-to-boost-revenue\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-to-use-banking-as-a-service-to-boost-revenue\"><\/span>How to Use Banking as a Service to Boost Revenue<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Baas is a model that is currently being implemented across several industries. Significant use cases of this model include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-online-banking-by-fintech-and-non-fintech-companies\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-online-banking-by-fintech-and-non-fintech-companies\"><\/span>1. Online Banking by Fintech and Non-Fintech Companies<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Baas can allow fintech and non-fintech companies to offer digital banking services. They can shift their focus to service providers instead of concentrating on bank licenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end products are usually user-friendly and more technologically advanced. It makes them better than the standard products offered by traditional banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the companies can develop apps to help consumers track their savings, account balances, and daily transactions. They can also:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I. Ensure customers have quick access to their funds whenever they need them<br>II. Do away with hidden fees to guarantee a better customer experience<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-offer-their-clients-debit-and-credit-cards\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-offer-their-clients-debit-and-credit-cards\"><\/span>2. Offer Their Clients Debit and Credit Cards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the Baas model allows non-fintech companies to offer their customers credit and debit cards. Consumers can use the mobile app to get real-time updates of all their transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All account details, including recent payments and deposits, are displayed in a user-friendly manner. Companies looking to boost business revenue can do so by lowering their rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, most companies have started to offer their customers cashback offers. The offers apply to both credit and debit cardholders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase customer satisfaction, the companies can offer cashback offers as assets without expiry. Or they could also apply to several products purchased through the apps, website, or in-store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-219\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-offer-loans-and-lend-assets-to-customers\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-offer-loans-and-lend-assets-to-customers\"><\/span>3. Offer Loans and Lend Assets to Customers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Baas makes it possible for businesses to lend funds and assets to loyal customers. For example, a travel agent can provide one-click loans to travellers to guarantee uninterrupted travel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a loan would also assist in improving the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this model, businesses can provide their customers with options such as \u201cBuy Now, Pay Later.\u201d Such options should allow clients to choose their preferred payment model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inbuilt app should allow clients to track all their monthly repayments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-offer-investment-services-to-the-consumers\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-offer-investment-services-to-the-consumers\"><\/span>4.

Assist in Verifying Customer Information<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Payment transfer and processing errors can cause an organization to lose its reputation. In some cases, it could cause a merchant to lose business, especially when the problem recurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The verification of banking information can assist in eliminating and preventing such errors. The platform can assist in verifying customer information before the payment process can begin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can prove helpful when processing bulk payments across multiple payment channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-banking-as-a-service-useful\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-makes-banking-as-a-service-useful\"><\/span>What Makes Banking as a Service Useful?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The model has assisted in solving several issues within the fintech industry. For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 It helps unlock banking: Fintech and non-fintech companies that want to offer banking services typically have to meet stringent requirements, e.g., securing a license. By plugging into the banks\u2019 system via an API, fintech companies can access the features they need to build a digital payments platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 It\u2019s great for consumers: Consumers are on the lookout for better experiences. These are things that traditional banks cannot offer. Baas allows them access to the experiences they desire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the challenges of implementing banking as a service are plenty, its use cases can help a company boost its revenue.
