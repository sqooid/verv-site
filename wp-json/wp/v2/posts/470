It is because of open banking that banks are able to grant TPPs access to their banking ecosystem. Inasmuch as Baas and open-banking may sound similar, there is a significant difference between these two practices in the banking as a service market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, open-banking is how a brand accesses a bank\u2019s data, including account balances and transaction types. Good examples of open banking vs banking as a service include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Car retailers and mortgage lenders providing personalized quotes off of a customer\u2019s financial history, especially for <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cross-border payments.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 How bookkeeping services tend to aggregate transaction histories from multiple accounts into one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Different credit scoring companies tabulating scores by studying customers\u2019 credit card data and payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, BaaS platforms essentially take steps further and grant brand access to their core functions like loan providers and credit cards. Therefore, the TPP can offer a customer benefit and let the bank to the heavy lifting, which includes financing and underwriting. Great examples include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Retailers or airlines offering white-labeled credit cards to customers who amass points for frequently flying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 A financing app partnering with e-commerce firms to offer split payments on different customer purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Building of licensed neobanks by FinTechs to offer unique customer experiences and interfaces. At the same time, they tap into the infrastructure of larger institutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"banks-using-baas-to-gain-greater-access-in-the-digital-marketplace\"><\/span>Banks using Baas to gain greater access in the digital marketplace.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite some banks viewing banking-as-a-service as a threat, other tech-savvy financial transaction institutions are grabbing the bull by the horns and taking advantage of this trend. Inasmuch as it may be an enormous financial undertaking, it can easily be a regulatory nightmare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code has just replaced the massive capital needed to complete these kinds of innovative initiatives. Therefore, banks essentially need to make it relatively easy for brands and businesses to participate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a lot of businesses, the different customer journeys come to a halt as a result of money-related issues. Therefore, instead of letting such disruptions interrupt the purchase experience, banking-as-a-service steps in to offer smoother customer interactions. The result is the conversion of more prospects into more paying customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When they offer such services to brands in need, different banks can serve their crucial need in a largely booming digital marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion-the-industry-outlook\"><\/span>Conclusion: The industry outlook<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different countries are now putting in place open banking regulations, which is an indication that the payments industry is moving towards shared infrastructure and data era and customers will expect nothing else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, many tech-savvy businesses creating their platforms will easily get ahead of the opportunities in open banking while unlocking new revenue streams by monetizing their platforms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Banking as a service can be considered a normal progression of digital transformation.
