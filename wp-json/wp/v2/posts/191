This was one of the ways the pandemic accelerated the adoption of online payments systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Social Distancing Requirements, Health Concerns and online payment mechanisms.<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19, governments and health agencies had to put in place regulations such as social distancing to prevent spread through contact. There was a need to develop digital payment platforms to support transactions between consumers and service providers without exchanging cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As governments encouraged cashless transactions, people received their wages and remittances online. Savings are also put away online instead of people queuing in banks to make deposits.<br>Civilians are not the only ones that have been forced to use digital transactions via online payment gateways. Governments are also using the same platforms to distribute welfare checks, pay civil servants, and collect taxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retailers that are still operating physical stores are also encouraging their customers to make digital payments to prevent the spread of the virus.

Instead, they prefer having the services brought to their doorsteps. Convenience has also become a priority in entertainment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic also saw a shift from traditional casino venues to online casino sites.
