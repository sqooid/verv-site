Mentor Employees Through their Mistakes<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When running a business empowerment fund, such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/business-account\/#:~:text=BUSINESS%20ACCOUNT-,Corporate%20Accounts,-With%20VERV%2C%20being\">corporate accounts<\/a> from Verv, it&#8217;s normal to expect mistakes to happen. As a manager, you need to empower your people to accept their mistakes. Use this as a learning opportunity to guide them on what to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mentoring your employees<\/strong> through their mistakes will give them room to grow. When sustained, it will assist in creating an organizational culture of resilience and growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it can prove challenging, you can use these tips to coach employees through a mistake:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid pointing fingers: While you need to point out what went wrong, avoid getting carried away, as this may lead to finger-pointing. Instead, focus on what went wrong and what the employee can do in the future to prevent such mistakes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep your emotions in check: Your attitude towards your people&#8217;s failure will determine if and when that employee will bounce back. Take time to deal with your negative emotions before approaching the employee at fault.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Show the employees what went wrong: Assisting your people to see what went wrong will make it easier to recover from failure. Try to hold a frank and honest discussion with your employees without sugarcoating the issue at hand.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Give your employees some elbow room: All the people working for you need some room. Allow them enough room to work, even after making a mistake. If you crowd their space in an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2020\/07\/16\/13-telltale-signs-that-a-manager-is-micromanaging-their-team\/?sh=2b7148491ccb#:~:text=2020%2C01%3A10pm%20EDT-,Micromanagement,-might%20sound%20like\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attempt at micromanagement,<\/a> the employees will resent you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-ensure-you-start-with-a-clear-vision\"><\/span>2. Ensure You Start with a Clear Vision<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Attracting personnel aligned with the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">purpose of your payment gateway<\/a> is an excellent way to assist them in feeling empowered to contribute to your goals. From here, you need to assist them in setting professional goals that will tie their success to that of your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this means that whenever they work on a Verv <strong>business account<\/strong>, they will feel that they are doing something fulfilling. Remember to include measurable steps in your vision to help your people get to where they need to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-delegate-work-and-responsibility\"><\/span>3. Delegate Work and Responsibility<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Empowerment and delegation in the business environment go hand in hand. When an employee understands their responsibilities, they begin taking ownership of what they are doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long-term, this will allow you to reduce <strong>micromanagement<\/strong>, allowing you to manage their work even less. Delegation is a show of faith in what the employees are doing, and it tells them that you trust them to get things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-give-your-employees-boundaries\"><\/span>4. Give Your Employees Boundaries<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving your employees boundaries is an ideal example of empowerment in leadership. The limits you define will enable the employees to make decisions on their own. They will base their decisions on the guidelines you have specified.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining boundaries provides them with the freedom to make choices. Some managers think that boundaries can hold employees back, but <strong>boundaries help empower them<\/strong>. They give them a say in different situations, some of which would have required them to consult you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-adopt-an-open-door-policy-for-your-office\"><\/span>5. Adopt an Open-Door Policy for Your Office<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a manager, you want your employees to understand that their opinions matter. Leaving your office door open is one of those empowerments in business examples every manager should emulate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a policy that tells your employees that you value them and what they have to say. While it may seem like a simple gesture, it will motivate them to communicate their input. The employees will start to play a more active role in the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6-build-strong-relationships-with-your-employees-based-on-mutual-trust\"><\/span>6. Build Strong Relationships with Your Employees Based on Mutual Trust<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Business empowerment means building solid <strong>relationships <\/strong>with your people based on mutual trust. You have to remember that employees now have lots of choices regarding employment options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees want to advance their careers, but they would rather do it in a fun place. You&#8217;ll want to keep them engaged and regularly let them know that they form a crucial part of the business mission.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure you choose the right people for every project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7-focus-on-connection-and-employee-growth\"><\/span>7. Focus on Connection and Employee Growth<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best business leaders focus on elevating the people they work with, including those around them. Unlike managers, leaders have to endeavour to create a business environment that&#8217;s inclusive and generally positive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an environment that should bring out the best in the people who work with them.

Develop a wealth of tools and resources and show the employees how they can use them to improve their work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tools and resources should remain available throughout, allowing them to use these tools whenever the need arises. While at it, try to encourage open communication and inform your team that you&#8217;re always open to engaging in a <strong>brainstorming session<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"9-work-to-earn-their-trust\"><\/span>9.

But this doesn&#8217;t mean that you should become unreachable when the times become stormy. Many managers tend to annihilate their people when the times are rough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You shouldn&#8217;t hire people to manage your business empowerment fund unless you&#8217;re willing to support them through thick and thin. While you&#8217;re probably relying on other business tools to manage customer loyalty, you shouldn&#8217;t take for granted the role played by your employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll foster unwavering loyalty in your team as you continue to earn their trust. These are people who will want to work for you, which will, in turn, enable you to achieve your <a href=\"https:\/\/speed.cy\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/speed.cy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business goals<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"10-supporting-vacation-time-as-part-of-empowerment-in-business-examples\"><\/span>10.

Employees will become more productive when they are rejuvenated and relaxed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you don&#8217;t have to mandate a couple of weeks at a time, try to foster a work environment that supports a long weekend every once in a while.
