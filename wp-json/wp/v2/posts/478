This went to people living in low and middle-class countries. In 2020, the amount of money transferred from developed countries was $550 billion. This went to developing and undeveloped countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This figure does not include the transaction costs incurred to transfer the money. The transfer cost is about 7% of the total transfers. It is equivalent to $38.5 billion.

The current system is also not conducive since it makes the process slow. The Federal Reserve is developing efficient systems for quick transfer of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an increase in the number of online financial services platforms. These online financial institutions help people send money abroad faster and affordably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, these online companies do not work for everyone.
