However, most people stick to common banking due to the good relationship they build with their clients. Knowing some of the advantages and disadvantages can help you decide between traditional banking vs modern banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"advantages-of-traditional-banking\"><\/span>Advantages of Traditional Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"they-offer-several-banking-options\"><\/span>They Offer Several Banking Options<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main features of traditional baking is that it provides a wide range of accounts. Unlike online banks, clients can choose to open different types of accounts that have varying benefits. Examples of these accounts include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Business checking account<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trust fund account<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Savings account<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Checking accounts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Brick and mortar banks also offer a huge number of services. Clients with different accounts can access wealth management and investment advice services. These banks also offer loan and mortgage services for clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"they-have-a-high-level-of-convenience\"><\/span>They Have a High Level of Convenience<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional banks are more convenient compared to online banks. Despite having online platforms, physical banks still offer in-person customer service. Clients can walk into the banking hall and get the services they need.<br>Common banks also provide access to ATM services. Clients can withdraw money from these points using their debit cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"they-offer-both-digital-and-traditional-services\"><\/span>They Offer Both Digital and Traditional Services<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most banks are changing their structure to cope with technological advancements. Clients can now use online services to transact through their accounts. Most banks have a mobile app that allows them to deposit and withdraw money from their accounts.<br>Clients also can visit the bank and deposit or withdraw cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"they-accept-cash-deposits\"><\/span>They Accept Cash Deposits<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the introduction of paperless cash, most companies still insist on receiving payments in cash. Such companies cannot benefit from fintech companies since they only deal with cash. Traditional banks give them a chance to deposit cash directly to their accounts, making them convenient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"services-offered-by-traditional-banks-are-secure\"><\/span>Services Offered by Traditional Banks are Secure<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional banks adopt secure systems to protect their clients\u2019 financial details.

However, they also have flaws that make people prefer online banking. Below are some of the major drawbacks associated with traditional banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little or no Interest Rates<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the rigid structure and high operational costs, brick-and-mortar banks offer low-interest rates. Some banks also offer interest rates on specific accounts, such as fixed saving accounts. Online banking institutions such as Verv offer high-interest rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"traditional-banks-have-a-wide-range-of-fees\"><\/span>Traditional Banks have a Wide Range of Fees<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks are known for their high transaction and service fees. Banks incur high operational costs hence the need to charge customers huge fees.
