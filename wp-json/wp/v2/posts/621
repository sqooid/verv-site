Growing beyond their core into ecosystems that are relevant<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many financial institutions have for a very long time relied on ensuring that customers are aware of their relevant products as a pathway to growth. This was mostly coupled with the introduction of other banking products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example is when a customer holding a checking account would be advised to consider a home improvement loan, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/personal-finance\/what-is-a-line-of-credit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personal line of credit<\/a> or bank credit card. This is just a way banks use to ignore the broader roles they should play on behalf of customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, when they chose to move into ecosystems other than their traditional core, they will proactively tap into their existing clientele and operational capabilities while strengthening engagement. Also, they will be able to capture data that will be instrumental in aiding banks in having a comprehensive view of their clients\u2019 needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving into new ecosystems could include aspects like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Offering cash-flow analysis to SMEs<\/li><li>Introducing accounts-receivable management<\/li><li>Offering accounting and factoring<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the Italian bank, Post Bank, is now the largest mobile phone services provider in the country just because they chose to go beyond their traditional core.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-come-up-with-a-form-of-the-financial-supermarket\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-come-up-with-a-form-of-the-financial-supermarket\"><\/span>2. Come up with a form of the financial supermarket<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks can also innovate by offering a vetted and curated mix of both internal and third-party services. Such a business model ensures clients enjoy easy, one-stop access to a wide range of services and products. Accessing multiple financial products via a single, integrated channel boosts customer experience and satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When banks integrate multiple financial products into one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/financialsupermarket.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">financial supermarket<\/a> allows them to narrow down their focus towards the high-return side of the digital payments industry. For instance, in the UK, about 60% of car insurance policies are offered via aggregators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, some banks are building privileged relationships with their customers by relying on recommendation engines that take advantage of customer, merchant and transaction data obtained from the platform to mint out personalised offers and suggestions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-ensuring-that-they-continue-extending-value-across-the-client-journey\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-ensuring-that-they-continue-extending-value-across-the-client-journey\"><\/span>3. Ensuring that they continue extending value across the client journey<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many customers just engage with banks as a means to an end. It could be because:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They want to grow their business<\/li><li>They want to secure their retirement<\/li><li>They want to buy a home<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, banks majorly focus on bank-centred and discrete moments in their customers\u2019 journey, like offering mortgages when their client\u2019s primary goal is to buy a house. When banks just focus on the bank-related aspect of the overall journey, they leave a huge chunk of value on the table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, with the digital age, banks can become part of the overall growth by engaging with customers on other non-bank related stages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, a bank can be instrumental in offering pieces of advice to their clients on just how much they can borrow for a home or save for retirement. At the same time, they can advise customers on how best they can determine the best maturities and rates for financial instruments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a good example is when the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) chose to become part of their customers\u2019 journeys towards home buying. Therefore, they came up with an augmented-reality mobile app, which allowed users to use their smartphone cameras to point at a property and view the sales history and current price instantly. It also includes a mortgage calculator among other financial tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/transfer-money-1-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-572\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/transfer-money-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/transfer-money-1-300x158.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/transfer-money-1-768x403.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/transfer-money-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-focus-on-becoming-digital-attackers\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-focus-on-becoming-digital-attackers\"><\/span>4. Focus on becoming digital attackers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Incumbent financial institutions can become part and parcel of the digital payments sector by employing novel business models or digital channels to creep into new market segments or geographies that would certainly be expensive targets if approached using traditional methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An excellent example of a digital attacker is ING Direct because it started an exclusive internet banking platform in 1996, which attracted over 20 million customers from 9 countries in just over a decade, before it established more subsidiaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such an example of venturing into online banking good idea if a bank wishes to venture into new segments or markets without having to put in heavy capital in physical infrastructure, which would definitely make this endeavour prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, it would be an incredible way of exploring new market opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-how-about-monetising-their-data\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-how-about-monetising-their-data\"><\/span>5. How about monetising their data?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent report by Mckinsey, more than half of financial institutions in the survey had begun monetising their data. Furthermore, it seemed that monetising data had a correlation with industry-leading performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some ways banks could monetise their data include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ensure effective use of their internal data for internal operations via the addition of new analytics capabilities<\/li><li>Creation of new offerings like benchmark analytics or reports<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, they can allow customers to use their internet banking credentials to access government services. It works in the same fashion as websites allowing users to access them using their Facebook accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the digital age of online banking, banks innovate through a variety of ways to ensure that they stay relevant in the digital payments industry.
