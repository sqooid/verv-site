You will have to evaluate the available tools and a payment gateway\u2019s position on fraud management. That is why this post covers the essentials you need to know about fraud detection mechanisms to make things easier for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/high-risk-countries.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1060\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/high-risk-countries.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/high-risk-countries-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/high-risk-countries-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Payment gateway fraud detection best practices<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Merchants can rest easy knowing that when they are dealing with high-risk payment gateways, their safety and that of their funds are well-taken care of. Therefore, for any digital payments company, it is important that they employ the following mechanisms:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Introducing Address Verification Services (AVS)<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you initiate any transaction on a payment processing platform, you have to enter your address together with your preferred digital payments method. This is where the AVS comes in. It is an important security measure designed to detect fraud during online transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When any customer makes a purchase, they will have to include their ZIP code and billing address. The AVS system will come into play to verify whether the keyed in information matches. If the system confirms the information match, it will authorize it. But if not, it will proceed to check the Card Verification Value (CVV), IP address and email address. If they don\u2019t match, the payment fraud detection system will decline the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Introducing biometric methodologies<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">biometric methodologies<\/a> in payments is relatively new practice but ultimately worth it. It has grown to become quite vital in the fight against payment fraud. They came to existence because the conventional kinds of identity verification proved less effective against fraud prevention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is now relatively easy to validate the identity of the individual making payments through different types of methodologies like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Finger and facial biometrics: They are the most common types of fraud prevention practices that come with facial recognition cameras and fingerprint readers to offer a more secure to authenticate online payments.<br>\u2022 Voice biometrics: These are becoming increasingly popular since more FinTech companies are requesting their clients to record their voice passwords to enable them add another layer of security to steer clear of fraudsters. Some require a \u2018passphrase; while others just run while you talk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Flagging large transactions<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When a potential fraudster gets access to a stolen card, they will be tempted to make a large purchase before the issuing financial institution blocks it. This will be a huge setback to any person or business for leaving loopholes for such transactions to take place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such instances could even make payment processors decline to engage with you by terminating the processing account. Therefore, in such instances, payment gateways for digital payments should limit the number of huge transactions. The best way to do this would be to specify the flat dollar amount to avoid chargebacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also do this by limiting the amount of failed transactions finding their way via the payment gateway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Taking note of high-risk countries<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When handling cross-border payments in the payments industry, you have to be extra careful, especially when dealing with shipping. Therefore, it would be best to keep an eye out for any orders that come from the countries that are considered \u2018\u2019high-risk.\u2019\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to go about this is by ensuring customers placing these overseas orders call the merchants for identity verification before the online payment is processed. It is crucial the merchants go through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lawsociety.org.uk\/en\/topics\/anti-money-laundering\/high-risk-third-countries-for-aml-purposes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Online Fraud Guid<\/a>e to know some of the countries listed with higher fraud rates like Ukraine, Nigeria, Malaysia, Pakistan, Egypt, Lithuania etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>Allow for Card Verification Value (CVV) checks<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise referred to as Card Verification Code (CVC), a CVV is a 3-4 digit code found at the back of all credit cards. No merchant should store this code in their database. Therefore, they should utilize a CVV filter to ensure added security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filter allows only the cardholder to pay with the card since it is only seen on the printed card. When a customer makes a payment and the CVV code doesn\u2019t match, a merchant should allow the payment gateway to decline this financial transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/risk-scoring.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1074\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/risk-scoring.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/risk-scoring-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/risk-scoring-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chargebee.com\/resources\/guides\/credit-card-processing-statistics\/#safety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> CVV filter<\/a> for website fraud detection is crucial in reducing chargebacks and a fantastic way a business can ensure ecommerce fraud prevention best practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\"><li><strong>Including a 3-D secure payer authentication software<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Also referred to as MasterCard SecureCode or Verified by Visa (VeB), payer authentication is a payment fraud detection measure that allows cardholders to come up with a PIN to confirm their identity when they complete a transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When businesses implement this on how to detect fraud transactions, they will be ideally ensuring chargeback protection while at the same time lowering the interchange rates. Furthermore, it constitutes one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cxpay.global\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Payer_Authentication.docx-CX-Pay.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">most-sought-after tools<\/a> for fraud detection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7. <strong>Input lockout mechanisms<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an ideal way to prevent different types of payment frauds and deter fraudsters who take advantage of automatic card number generator software. Such programs are available in underground fraud databases and could easily generate several credit card numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, a fraudster will try out many different card numbers until they find a valid one and charge the cards until they exhaust them. To ensure this doesn\u2019t happen, payment gateways could:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Disable any transactions that don\u2019t pass the AVS test mentioned above.<br>\u2022 If a particular IP has many credit cards declined at a particular time, they should lock out the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"8\"><li><strong>How about considering risk scoring?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Different risk scoring tools are designed to recognize potentially fraudulent financial transactions basing it on a set of rules. The tool will assess any transaction on a payment gateway and indicate how probable it is for that transaction to be fraudulent via payment fraud detection machine learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It provides evaluations of a case by case, and they will just flag any transaction it deems fraudulent depending on the chosen rules like IP range, billing address AVS test failure and anonymous emails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the growth of the payments industry comes an increased number of fraudulent transactions. That is why payment gateways with a high risk of fraud need to ensure that they include some of these tactics to eradicate online payment fraud like Worldpay fraud prevention.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many card processors in the digital payments world only offer basic fraud detection mechanisms.
