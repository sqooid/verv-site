Today, the term features prominently among C-suite executives, IT Leaders, and board members when discussing cloud computing and its effects on a corporate growth strategy.<br>Thanks to omnichannel corporate growth, companies operating in the financial sector can now boost revenue and cut costs through process automation. All this has become possible due to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/news\/payments-innovation\/2021\/payments-as-an-integral-part-of-the-customer-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">superior customer experiences<\/a> offered by online payment companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking2.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud banking\" class=\"wp-image-230\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-does-cloud-banking-mean-when-used-with-regards-to-a-financial-transaction\"><\/span>What Does Cloud Banking Mean When Used with Regards to a Financial Transaction?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate clients can today make digital payments and payment processing using various channels such as:<br><br>\u2022 Physical bank branches<br>\u2022 Official company websites<br>\u2022 Call centers<br>\u2022 Mobile applications<br><br>However, most banking clients fail to realize that it has a lot more to offer to the payments industry. A true omnichannel corporate cloud banking platform provides for automated data synchronizations between the various channels in use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, customers can begin an onboarding process using a given channel and complete it using a completely different channel. The financial transactions platform makes this a possibility without requiring the users to provide their data afresh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, this type of banking has numerous implications for omnichannel corporate growth. Depending on how the institution has deployed it, it can significantly impact customer retention rates, onboarding processes and boost marketing performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Verv we ensure that <a href=\"http:\/\/verv.novatti.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">onboarding <\/a>is carried out fully on our own platform, for both data security and convenience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"why-use-cloud-computing-in-the-deployment-of-a-corporate-growth-strategy\"><\/span>Why Use Cloud Computing in the Deployment of a Corporate Growth Strategy<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud computing solutions continue to catalyze digital payments transformation. Its benefits have a significant impact on the operations taking place in the front and back offices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are benefits that assist in making corporate cloud banking institutions future-ready while serving as a springboard for enhanced client value and revenue generation. Some of the benefits that cloud computing offers to the payments industry include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced Data and Continuity Risks<br><\/strong>The factors that were once considered the greatest weaknesses of cloud technology have now become its most significant strengths. It\u2019s a technology that seeks to offer viable alternatives to payments solution previously regarded as outdated and highly vulnerable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many payment processing systems were susceptible to data breaches and cyberattacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud-based payment processors can provide better security against cyberattacks thanks to their ability to instantly identify potential breaches. The systems come with embedded data that assists in safeguarding corporate banking information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate online payment systems can also benefit from its high redundancy levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved Customer Insights<\/strong><br>Corporate client information contains insights that are only accessible using advanced analytics. The results obtained from real-time analysis of online payment trends can help in providing a foundation for proactive engagement across different banking channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It particularly makes a lasting impact among payment processing channels not commonly used with legacy infrastructure. The availability of automated analysis means that credit unions and banks can now understand customer behavior more easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can then use this information to trigger omnichannel corporate growth actions that can assist in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Building loyalty among clients using the digital payment system<br>\u2022 Increasing conversion through the online payment facilities<br>\u2022 Increasing engagement with all its online banking clients<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Greater Agility<\/strong><br>For credit unions and banks that want to achieve greater agility in their operations, cloud banking makes it easier to change market conditions and leverage customer data. They both help the institutions to attain benefits linked to better operational productivity.<br>The existing opportunities range from the scalability of technology to responding to changing competitive dynamics and consumer behavior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enhanced Innovation<\/strong><br>Cloud computing technology can assist in shortening product deployment cycles and real-time monitoring of product acceptance or rejection by the market. The solutions also support open banking possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial institutions can deploy them to expand their payments solution offerings to consumers using traditional and non-traditional banking services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Improved Efficiency<\/strong><br>Most companies operating in the payments industry have difficulty streamlining, connecting, and automating back-office operations intended to boost client experiences. Cloud-based solutions assist in bringing together several operating systems that help in increasing efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data systems live in silos and can reduce the time spent by IT personnel looking for insight on more impactful and productive decision-making strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking1.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud banking\" class=\"wp-image-231\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/cloud_banking1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"cloud-computing-is-the-future-of-corporate-cloud-banking\"><\/span>Cloud Computing is the Future of Corporate Cloud Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to benefit from the transformations taking place in the digital payments sector is to embrace the cloud.

Firms supporting financial transactions are increasingly implementing them due to their perceived benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the use of machine learning, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence requires payment processors to possess machines with better processing power. Fortunately, companies like IBM have begun to provide bespoke industry-specific solutions for the financial sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using these industry-specific cloud-based solutions, companies now have an opportunity to improve their competitive positions and drive innovation.
