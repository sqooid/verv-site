financial services is snowballing. Today, about 80% of banks are aware of the benefits of AI, and 75% have already implemented <strong>AI technology<\/strong> in their businesses. To make things even more interesting, 66% of these banks are generating a reasonable amount of income by simply using AI tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI technology in business banking is used to make digital payments easier and more efficient. But its primary purpose is to execute human-like decisions more accurately and faster. It is projected that by 2023 several banks will have set aside $447 billion by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/blogposting\/20688\/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-banking-world-today\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">implementing and developing AI applications<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"impacts-of-ai-on-business-banking\"><\/span>Impacts of AI on Business Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/innovation-in-services.jpg\" alt=\"ai technology\" class=\"wp-image-822\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/innovation-in-services.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/innovation-in-services-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/innovation-in-services-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many online banks like Verv that have leveraged or taken advantage of AI technology are seeing its impact in one or the other way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as there are risks involved with AI technology, most banks have addressed most issues to do with AI risks. It can be safely said that the benefits these banks experience are endless. Here are some of the best ones;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"it-boosts-customer-experience\"><\/span>It Boosts Customer Experience<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to improve customer experience is to communicate well and set up reliable digital payment systems. The amazing thing is that AI can do just that. They can be set up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lilachbullock\/2019\/02\/25\/the-top-6-ways-that-artificial-intelligence-will-affect-your-business-in-the-near-future\/?sh=1596a99d1966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">address customer issues<\/a> and help them make payments conveniently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is always done by implementing chatbots that can assist customers 24\/7. The good thing is that customers are already used to the software program and comfortably use them to ask questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"artificial-intelligence-is-suitable-for-fraud-protection\"><\/span>Artificial Intelligence Is Suitable for Fraud Protection<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fraud and cybercrime activities are the biggest threats facing banking services for business. But with an AI-powered tool, things have significantly changed over the past few years. AI has been excellent for battling any fraudulent activities. It does this by tracking;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Client&#8217;s behaviour<\/li><li>Buying habits<\/li><li>Location, etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever it detects anything out of order, it activates its security mechanism, stopping any financial crime that may be going on. Verv is one financial service using AI technology to ensure there is no danger during financial transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has implemented a multi-decentralized blockchain network to ensure all transactions occur successfully. The technology encrypts, shreds, and distributes various pieces of data across multiple ledges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"credit-decisions-and-loans\"><\/span>Credit Decisions and Loans<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence has also impacted banks when it comes to making decisions about loans and credit cards. It allows the financial services to make faster credit card assessments and know potential borrowers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With AI technology, lenders can quickly know those individuals who are more likely to default. Apart from that, it allows banks to issue loans more conveniently. Borrowers do not have to visit the bank in person; instead, the bank uses AI-powered apps to give loans to legitimate customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with this is that sometimes AI tools can be biased and offer loans to a specific group of people. But this can always be counteracted by training AI to be non-biased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"personal-banking-is-possible-with-ai\"><\/span>Personal Banking Is Possible with AI<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI technology in business banking makes personal banking possible. Instead of waiting for bank personnel to arrive, you can conduct transactions 24\/7. This is because AI allows banks to implement chatbots and payment processors, enabling all transactions to flow smoothly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also a great advantage to business owners as they do not have to lose customers because of unreliability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ai-improves-the-automation-process\"><\/span>AI Improves the Automation Process<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence also makes the automation process easy in banks and reduces operational costs. Companies like Verv and many others have taken advantage of AI-powered tools to introduce <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">payment gateways<\/a> in their business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows businesses to sell their goods across borders. Put simply, AI technology in banking enables other companies to have a steady income flow as they can sell their merchants globally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recruitments Practices Becomes Easier with AI<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you wondering how to get the best financial managers and analysts for your business banking service? The best way to do this is to use AI-powered tools. You only need to feed them with what you need, and they will help you find what you are looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it is said that AI will replace human resource jobs, it can still help you to find the best candidates for your finance business whenever you need one. AI can access body language, and voice tone, and conduct interviews like human beings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"risks-involved-with-using-ai-in-business-banking\"><\/span>Risks Involved With Using AI in Business Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fintechnews.org\/ai-in-banks-risks-and-opportunities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">common risks<\/a> that you might experience while using or implementing AI-powered tools in your business. First, AI can make wrong decisions and sometimes be biased depending on how humans developed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, it can lead to customer mistrust. This is because while using the AI-powered tool, customer interaction is lost, and some customers may find your company illegitimate, especially when your chatbots make mistakes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another risk is that AI tools can use complicated language that is not easily understandable. This becomes a challenge, especially when it comes to financial institution regulations. When customers want to understand them, it can become quite tricky, and you may have to do it yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-to-mitigate-ai-risks\"><\/span>How to Mitigate AI Risks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be several risks related to the application of AI in the banking sector. The good news is that all these risks can be eliminated so that both customers and businesses find it safe to use financial services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to do this is to ensure control measures are in place to eliminate risks involved with AI-powered tools. Service providers should also assist in accessing the tools now and then to ensure they are working effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A financial service like Verv frequently updates its technology to avoid minor mistakes. It also has a reliable customer support system that allows customers to address their issues concerning digital payments, among many other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"is-artificial-intelligence-a-good-thing-in-business-banking\"><\/span>Is Artificial Intelligence a Good Thing in Business Banking?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence has had a significant impact on business banking negatively and positively.
