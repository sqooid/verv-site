This means that all businesses should use electronic transactions to send and receive money from customers safely. The good news is that the concept of electronic funds transfer applies to businesses and customers. But both parties need to understand how it works to avoid scams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology allows money to move fast, making businesses grow and promoting customer satisfaction. It is an essential part of the economy as it allows money to be transacted from person to person. This article will help you understand how electronic funds transfer works, why you should use it and the types available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-is-electronic-funds-transfer\"><\/span>What is Electronic Funds Transfer?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is EFT in banking? Electronic funds transfer can be described as payments done over an online network. It can be from one bank account to another bank account. For the payments to be completed, there must be two parties involved. That is the sender and the receiver. It is not a must for the accounts to be from the same financial services. Funds transfer will still happen even when both parties are using different accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing is that when using electronic banking, know that there is no need for paperwork. You can send money directly through an app, card reader, or computer. The good news is that the Electronic Funds Transfer ACT protects all people who use electronic banking. This ensures that all individuals safely transact through the electronic banking system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"advantages-and-drawbacks-of-eft\"><\/span>Advantages and Drawbacks of EFT.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any other payment system, the wireless transfer comes with its pros and cons. Here are electronic funds transfer advantages and disadvantages you should know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"advantages-of-electronic-fund-transfer\"><\/span>Advantages of electronic fund transfer:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Merchants can access money Faster<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a popular advantage of electronic fund transfer that makes electronic banking stand out. Merchants enjoy using electronic banking as they can get their funds faster. It also reduces bank fees and saves time. Apart from that, customers can send money fast and receive what they have purchased within a few days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There is no need for a credit or debit card<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many online businesses accept payments through electronic check conversion. This means you can complete a financial transaction without a card. The linked bank account will send the payment directly to the receiver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It is safe to receive money through EFT<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The electronic banking system is rapidly growing because of many online businesses. The problem is that so many fraudsters try to take advantage of businesses and customers. This has forced financial services to set strict transaction measures to ensure scams do not occur, making electronic banking safe to use. Some services like Verv provide their customers with a<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> payment gateway<\/a> to make transactions flow smoothly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"drawbacks\"><\/span>Drawbacks.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you lose money, it may not be recovered<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you lose your money during a wire transfer, it may be hard to trace who the recipient was. Funds may be sent to overseas accounts and withdrawn instantly by the receiver. When this happens, it will be impossible to get your funds back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some EFTs fees are high<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another disadvantage is some services charge high transaction fees. Several electronic funds transfer companies have different transaction fees. But some are very expensive. The good thing is that business owners always try to find affordable financial services for customers to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-electronic-funds-transfer-works\"><\/span>How Electronic Funds Transfer Works.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are wondering how to receive EFT payments, it is crucial to understand how electronic funds transfer works. It will help you know how to utilize the payment system. EFT transactions are usually made via a computer or phone using an internet connection. When using it, you do not have to deal with cash; all the transactions are mainly done through the exchange of data. This is what represents your money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most businesses use EFT to send and receive money. For the electronic fund transfer process to happen successfully, you must know the receiver\u2019s bank information and authorize the EFT payment. From there, the money will be sent to the receiver. The financial service you are using will deduct their set transaction fee. Then send the rest of the payments to the receiver.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-electronic-funds-transfer-works-1.jpg\" alt=\"electronic funds transfer\" class=\"wp-image-555\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-electronic-funds-transfer-works-1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-electronic-funds-transfer-works-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-electronic-funds-transfer-works-1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"types-of-electronic-funds-transfer\"><\/span>Types of Electronic Funds Transfer.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/understanding-electronic-funds-transfer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">several types of EFT<\/a>, but this post will look at the 4 most common types of electronic fund transfer.
