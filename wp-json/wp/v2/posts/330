In some cases, some online payment services tend to be money-grabbing and sleazy, putting retailers at a disadvantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, any good digital payment system should always strive to find ways they can create more value for merchants while developing a good customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one system is perfect, but it will strive to offer the best services. However, there are some issues that you might end up facing in your quest to find the best digital payments gateway for your business. If you are not careful, these issues could end up plaguing your business. Here, you will learn more about some of these issues and how best to avoid them to secure your financial services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"online-payment-issues-you-may-face\"><\/span>Online payment issues you may face<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section of this post, you will learn about 5 of the most common online payment issues that affect merchants as they try to select a digital payment system. Here they are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Issues about cybersecurity fraud<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybersecurity fraud is one of the most prevalent issues facing the digital payments industry, especially with the rapid growth of the payment industry in the last few months. The issue is mostly related to compromised data security and the continued effort by fraudsters to breach data with every opportunity they get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, in 2019 alone, about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/the-ascent\/research\/identity-theft-credit-card-fraud-statistics\/#:~:text=There%20were%20650%2C572%20cases%20of%20identity%20theft%20in%202019.&amp;text=With%20over%20270%2C000%20reports%2C%20credit,through%20data%20breaches%20in%202019.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">650,000 cases <\/a>of identity theft were reported, and it is the most common type of fraud. In most of these cases, credit card fraud was the leasing, and it accounted for about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iii.org\/fact-statistic\/facts-statistics-identity-theft-and-cybercrime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">45% of these cases.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases involved fraudsters opening unauthorized accounts and using credit cards to their limits. With the increased data breaches, cases of identity theft are expected to rise. This will lead to an increase in data breaches because of the exposure of sensitive information. These cases even became worse with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic because the grounds because too fertile for cyber-attacks because of the increased online payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>The issue of chargebacks also comes into play<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, chargebacks are forced refunds to the customer, especially from credit card transactions. This happens when the issuing financial institution has frameworks in place to protect its clients from electronic payment fraud. Inasmuch as a good thing, it is a grave concern when choosing a payment gateway because chargebacks gauge an online business&#8217;s health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A higher rate of chargebacks is a reflection of bad business because of the decreased number of authorization rates. Furthermore, the liability of these chargebacks mostly falls on online merchants, and it can cost their businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/limited-mobility-in-a-payment-gateway.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1062\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/limited-mobility-in-a-payment-gateway.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/limited-mobility-in-a-payment-gateway-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/limited-mobility-in-a-payment-gateway-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>The aspect of payment integration<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Many payment gateway questions about online payment processors mostly arise because of the ease of payment integration. This is an issue because, with the increased size of the ecommerce market, merchants are rushing to satisfy their customers the needs of their customers with new forms of payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, in the event a merchant doesn\u2019t integrate multi-channel payments, they will end up using a single vendor for POS payments and another for online payments. This translates to increased costs and processing issues. Furthermore, without the integration of digital payment systems, a business could become trapped in an archaic payment processing system that has minimal capabilities. This is one of the online payment problems today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>How about limited mobility?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, many consumers don\u2019t want to feel tied to only one device when performing a financial transaction online. They want financial services that can take place anywhere, 24\/7, and from any device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a business is yet to migrate to modern systems, it may not offer the mobility that customers are used to, especially with the fast-paced evolution of the industry. Can payment apps replace checking accounts? Is this also among the payment gateway questions that arise considering the increased rate of technological advancements? This is because there is some aspect of convenience when customers use financial mobile payment solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li><strong>The issue of recurring payments<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as recurring payments ensure a steady flow of cash, there is a need for businesses to select a gateway that can manage a complex, responsive and direct multi-channel relationship with the clients, especially in the subscription economy today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a number of cases, recurring payments fail because of canceled or expired debit and credit cards. Therefore, a payment gateway should avoid such incidences and put in place frameworks that will ensure optimal payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-do-you-solve-these-issues\"><\/span>How do you solve these issues?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you face any of these issues, here is how you can go about it as you think about what are the key factors to consider when selecting a payment service:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 For cybersecurity fraud, ensure there are frameworks in place to help curb any case of fraud like fraud detection plugins to ensure that your customers enjoy their<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/technology\/#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20next%20generation%20of%20data%20security.%20Verv%20uses%20multi%2Ddecentralized%20private%20blockchain%20networks%20to%20ensure%20that%20data%20is%20no%20danger%20at%20any%20point%20during%20transfer.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> safety online.<\/a><br>\u2022 if you wish to avoid chargebacks, ensure there is excellent customer support in place to sort out issues as they arise.
