It\u2019s what finance experts call Banking as a Service (Baas).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A majority of the leading tech companies have already started to offer similar services to their clients.

Some believe that it can transform this sector and change the direction of the global markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banking as a service makes it possible for brands to introduce new digital products, e.g., <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift.\">digital payments<\/a> solutions and services. It\u2019s also known as white-label banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such companies can launch payment processors in a fast and affordable manner. Additionally, they don\u2019t have to apply for a banking license as the banks already have them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the chief reason they\u2019re expected to play a crucial role in this sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"baas-how-does-it-work\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"baas-how-does-it-work\"><\/span>Baas\u2014How Does It Work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A regulated institution needs to open up its API for the process to apply Baas in the digital payments sector to begin. They can open it up to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Fintech companies<br>\u2022 Digital banks<br>\u2022 Third-party provides<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These firms will need to pay a certain fee to use the Baas platform and benefit from its many business opportunities. Once they have gained access, they can now start developing new solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These solutions will allow them to provide white label banking services to their clients. Their clients can include a brand or business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, Baas requires the involvement of three leading players:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Nonbanking companies: Companies that want to offer financial products and services to their clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Banking institutions: Businesses with banking licenses would like to open up their APIs to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Third-party\/Fintech providers: The technological companies that link the business and the bank. They are in charge of developing financial products and solutions. Many view them as a bridge between all the players involved in this model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-152\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"business-opportunities-for-all-the-above-players\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"business-opportunities-for-all-the-above-players\"><\/span>Business Opportunities for All the Above Players<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/blogposting\/21085\/banking-as-a-service-baas-opening-new-revenue-opportunities-for-banks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Baas model<\/a>, all the players involved have an opportunity to grow or improve on their client base. They can do this by acquiring new clients looking for digital payments\u2019 services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a look at the opportunities for each party;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-the-consumer-or-the-end-user-empowerment\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-the-consumer-or-the-end-user-empowerment\"><\/span>1. The Consumer or the End User Empowerment<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The consumer has access to more information than ever before. They are, therefore, becoming empowered customers.<br>Empowerment encourages them to demand direct and integrated experiences with every product or service they receive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It explains why users are increasingly flocking to ecosystems within the financial sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-when-brands-and-businesses-become-banking-institutions\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-when-brands-and-businesses-become-banking-institutions\"><\/span>2. When Brands and Businesses Become Banking Institutions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, businesses and brands are now able to satisfy customer needs. The platforms allow them to meet customer needs in a more integrated manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital payments solutions create loyal and longer-lasting relationships with their clients in the process. It\u2019s one of the main goals of running a business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following this context means that banks are also winning by getting a chance to expand their portfolios. In the long term, they will end up with more satisfied clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, all these gains will come quickly and at a low price. All this is due to the embedded finance model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-digital-banks-or-fintech-the-banking-platforms-as-a-service-providers\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-digital-banks-or-fintech-the-banking-platforms-as-a-service-providers\"><\/span>3. Digital Banks or Fintech, the Banking Platforms as a Service Providers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The final product suppliers get to create a strategic partnership with the banking institutions. It\u2019s an alliance that enables them to offer technological solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can use these partnerships to create new business lines at exciting margins. Through it, they get to gain a deeper understanding of client behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All they have to do is use the data they have at their disposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-financial-or-banking-facilities-as-regulated-institutions\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-financial-or-banking-facilities-as-regulated-institutions\"><\/span>4. Financial or Banking Facilities as Regulated Institutions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The question in many people\u2019s minds is, \u201cwill banks gain anything by opening up their software to third parties?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies in the banking sector have an opportunity to charge nonbanking companies an access fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any company that wants to use their banking platform as a service will have to part with an access fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, they can choose to charge the companies using a pay-as-you-go model. Here, the companies will have to pay for every service they use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks now have an opportunity to penetrate new markets which may have been out of their reach in the past.<br>What\u2019s more, the banking-as-a-service platform helps provide transparency in the financial sector by allowing third parties to build on existing APIs from banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"industry-outlook-for-banking-as-a-service\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"industry-outlook-for-banking-as-a-service\"><\/span>Industry Outlook for Banking as a Service<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several countries have started introducing open banking regulations. It indicates that the financial sector is moving towards an era where consumers can expect more shared data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legacy banks that develop their own platforms will get to take advantage of emerging business opportunities before their competitors. It will also help them to unlock new revenue streams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remarkably, banking as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/scarlettsieber\/2021\/03\/03\/open-banking-what-does-it-mean-for-the-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">service falls under the Open Banking<\/a> framework.
