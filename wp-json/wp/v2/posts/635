However, things continue changing and bringing forward a host of other challenges that point to the need for boosting efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the challenges include new technologies and innovations and changes in consumer preferences and expectations, which are significantly transforming the banking nature. It is now morphing into a digitally-based business model through banking as a service while trying to retain some aspects of conventional services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, for any bank to remain competitive, it has to put the customer needs first by investing more in technology and innovation, integrating self-service capabilities, optimising its legacy investments and improving automation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these things put extra pressure on these financial institutions\u2019 operating budgets, which causes executives to start thinking of strategies to employ to cut down on expenditures to cater for marketing, new technology and capabilities to remain competitive. The goal is to become more efficient in every area and it is a vital strategic objective for banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-248\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect-from-banks-in-the-coming-years\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-to-expect-from-banks-in-the-coming-years\"><\/span>What to expect from banks in the coming years<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">digital payments<\/a> ecosystem is continuously going mainstream, mostly enjoyed by younger consumers, other customers are now hopping on board. Therefore, it is one of the greatest accelerations in the digital-banking spheres. This section covers some of the important BaaS movements you can expect in the near future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-using-seamless-digital-tools-to-create-long-running-customer-relationships\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-using-seamless-digital-tools-to-create-long-running-customer-relationships\"><\/span>1. Using seamless digital tools to create long-running customer relationships<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic caused an enormous economic downtime because of the lockdown orders, which called for closer financial scrutiny among customers. This is set to cause more customers to start thinking of selecting new banks to enjoy better services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should be a cause for concern for banks because there is a need for investing in banking as a service, especially in relationship building between customers and banking systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the premise of banks is to cash in human connection at the local branches, the sector is now facing the challenge of ensuring that customers stay engaged in this digital era. Therefore, they have to come up with strategies like offering fantastic resources, tools and services to boost the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-creating-a-balance-between-digital-and-in-person-banking\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-creating-a-balance-between-digital-and-in-person-banking\"><\/span>2. Creating a balance between digital and in-person banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial institutions are now largely focused on BaaS, especially on digital resources and tools and this trend is expected to continue. However, the real question is, where does human interaction come in in the conventional in-person financial business?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether the interaction is through online chats, one-on-one at the branches or a combination of both, the relationship exists because of some loyalty to a bank. It is not just about some sign-up bonus or the highest interest rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interpersonal relationship is crucial, based in part on the belief that a customer\u2019s assets are secure and all their financial needs met. If there isn\u2019t some form of human touch to the whole customer experience, there may be some disconnect between customers and their banks, which might lead to continued customer churn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expectation is that these financial institutions will invest more in digital tools while focusing hybrid customer experience model since customers are expected to reduce their bank visits and increase using digital payments platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-banks-will-continue-investing-more-in-enhanced-cybersecurity-tools\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-banks-will-continue-investing-more-in-enhanced-cybersecurity-tools\"><\/span>3. Banks will continue investing more in enhanced cybersecurity tools<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital banking isn\u2019t entirely a new phenomenon, but the recent uptake of customers in using websites and mobile apps for their financial needs creates a prime target for malicious hacking activities. Banks now have to invest more in digital security resources to ensure that their customers continue staying protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deloitte Center for Financial Services Global Outlook Survey 2020 survey contends that 71% of the existing bank leaders expect firms to increase their spending on cybersecurity, with a focus on data privacy and cloud storage\/computing to limit the risk of data breaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the frequency of data breaches has significantly declined in 2020 as compared to the years before, there is still a need to ensure that these numbers continue to reduce in the coming years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-what-this-means-for-consumers\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion-what-this-means-for-consumers\"><\/span>Conclusion: What this means for consumers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The continued emphasis and movement to digital was something that was already in the process even before the pandemic. However, the pandemic was a key catalyst in accelerating the process, which makes the digital payments ecosystem not just a nicety but a necessity.
