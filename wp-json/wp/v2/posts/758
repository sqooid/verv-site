But is banking as a service platform satisfying your client&#8217;s needs? Learning what your clients expect can make it easier to offer a better banking experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many successful businesses in the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/introduction-to-banking-on-the-internet\/#:~:text=common%20knowledge%20that-,banking,-is%20a%20crucial\">banking industry<\/a> understand the importance of providing their clients with a custom smartphone app. Such an app enables the customers to gain direct access to the bank&#8217;s digital experience, eCommerce store, and official website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks need such services to provide on-the-go solutions to their clients. However, a custom app isn&#8217;t everything. Clients expect the facilities they are dealing with to anticipate their needs and create a strategy to guarantee them access to the best services possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_45 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\" area-label=\"ez-toc-toggle-icon-1\"><label for=\"item-673d661a3e1e8\" aria-label=\"Table of Content\"><span style=\"display: flex;align-items: center;width: 35px;height: 30px;justify-content: center;direction:ltr;\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/label><input  type=\"checkbox\" id=\"item-673d661a3e1e8\"><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/top-5-tips-to-better-online-banking\/#5-tips-to-use-in-improving-your-banking-as-a-service-experience\" title=\"5 Tips to Use in Improving Your Banking as A Service Experience\">5 Tips to Use in Improving Your Banking as A Service Experience<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/top-5-tips-to-better-online-banking\/#tip-1-implement-advanced-financial-technology\" title=\"Tip 1.

Better customer experience will enable you to increase the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/online-banking-made-easier-with-online-banking\/#:~:text=growth%20of%20the-,internet%20banking,-sector%20does%20not\">adoption of internet banking<\/a>, thereby reducing the stress placed on other banking facilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"tip-1-implement-advanced-financial-technology\"><\/span>Tip 1. Implement Advanced Financial Technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses operating in the financial sector have to balance meeting customer demands and remaining compliant with existing laws and regulations. Though it seems like a tricky balancing act, it&#8217;s doable, especially when you add technology into the equation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deploying the latest financial technology in your business will enable you to strike this balance. Customers will get a streamlined way to perform their banking, and the efficiency of your customer support team will become significantly enhanced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining the two leads to better revenue generation and significantly enhanced customer satisfaction. When using financial technology to boost efficiency and customer fulfilment, you should consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Using biometrics, e.g., fingerprint, voice, and eye scanning to boost security<\/li><li>Relying on social media to enhance marketing. Use it to target clients in different locations.<\/li><li>Deploying a more sophisticated <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">platform for mobile payments<\/a><\/li><li>Using the latest video technology to customize the customer&#8217;s online banking experience<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"tip-2-use-reduced-customer-input-and-streamlined-navigation-to-minimize-effort\"><\/span>Tip 2. Use Reduced Customer Input and Streamlined Navigation to Minimize Effort<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal mobile banking platform should incorporate instant redirects and proper navigation. The two will come in handy in pointing the banking customer to the information, resources, or services they need to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the design phase, consider incorporating icons and landmarks, e.g.,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Labels<\/li><li>Section navigation tools<\/li><li>Search boxes in the banking platform<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Their addition will make a sophisticated platform appear intuitive and straightforward. The design team can use touch heat maps to identify problem areas in the navigation before releasing newer versions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers want to use an app or platform that doesn&#8217;t require too much information or effort from them. For example, consider setting up defaults or automatically populating data for repetitive actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling predictive text, spell-check, and auto-suggestion can reduce customer errors and effort. Just make sure that you don&#8217;t overdo it, as this may turn some clients away. If done correctly, it will reduce the time spent inputting client data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people.jpg\" alt=\"Tip number 3, artificial intelligence vs people\" class=\"wp-image-805\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"tip-3-consider-having-an-ai-and-real-person-option\"><\/span>Tip 3. Consider Having an AI and Real Person Option<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More and more banking as a service platform are including automated AI assistants to help their clients navigate their experiences efficiently. Depending on the website setup, the designers may choose to go with either of two options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>A Chatbot: The chatbot will pop up immediately a user accesses the website to ask what they need and whether they need any help.<\/li><li>Pop-up Message: If a chatbot isn&#8217;t present, the platform can include a pop-up message, e.g., &#8220;How can I help you?&#8221;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Both AI versions will work for the platform and guide the user to the services they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Real Person Option<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While AI options have become commonplace in most banking platforms, some customers believe banking systems have become too automated. Although these automated options can guide them to where they need to go, some clients want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2021\/06\/15\/want-to-build-your-brands-reputation-try-enhancing-the-customer-support-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">talk to real people.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real person option helps when the customer request appears complicated for the AI to understand. Ensure that the platform has a one-call option to connect the client to a customer service rep over the phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients using desktop versions may want access to a chat button. They should get connected to a real person on the other end on activating the chat feature. This way, they will get a chance to explain in detail what they need from the agent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"tip-4-use-explainer-videos-to-simplify-financial-concepts\"><\/span>Tip 4. Use Explainer Videos to Simplify Financial Concepts<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The average human has a short attention span and will frown at the thought of having to read through a lengthy paragraph. And those who do read them may fail to grasp most of the financial terms used on your banking as a service platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies show that up to <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/12933\/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50% of website visitors<\/a> will leave a platform within the first 15 seconds. The best way to avoid this is by using short videos on your platform. Such videos should feature feel-good background music, easy-to-understand scripts, and attractive graphics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use these videos to explain any financial concepts that regular people may have a hard time understanding. Additional ways to attract engagement and provide a positive banking experience include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Using YouTube tutorials to explain how the entire platform works<\/li><li>Influencer posts to inform your clients of new and upcoming services<\/li><li>Explainer videos on terms that may prove complex for non-techie clients<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"tip-5-empower-your-people-and-personalize-training\"><\/span>Tip 5. Empower Your People and Personalize Training<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Build advocacy and create awareness among your frontline personnel before introducing new features to your banking as a service platform. Train them, engage them, and let them participate in the pilot programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that your personnel understands the benefits that will arise from introducing these features. It&#8217;s impossible for staff to confidently promote a platform or the new features it promises when they don&#8217;t know how it can benefit their clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you engage in the training sessions, collect feedback from them, and use the questions they raise to create a comprehensive list of FAQs. Select the &#8216;product champions&#8217; to spearhead the promotion exercises from the information collected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why You Need to Prioritize Employee Training<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of time, effort, and resources assigned to employee training can impact the customer&#8217;s overall banking experience. Your employees need to understand how the system works before offering any help to clients who encounter issues when using it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If using an in-house solution, have the team conduct training sessions to teach your people what to expect, how the platform works, and how it will benefit the clients. You should only roll it out after your support team has understood its inner workings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies using solutions sourced from third parties should request training manuals. Use these to train your people and guide them on how the banking as a service platform works, its features, and why they should actively promote it to your clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-takeaway-from-these-five-tips\"><\/span>The Takeaway from these Five Tips<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that every banking facility will have a broad customer base. From the five tips explained above, some will work better for some facilities than others. As such, there&#8217;s a need to assess the platform&#8217;s performance regularly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from providing access to client accounts, you should use the digital experience to market all your upcoming products and services. If the facility has recently started to offer auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, or private loans, make sure to display this on the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offering the best banking as a service experience involves ensuring clients have a chance to customize their experience.
