Inasmuch as the process today isn\u2019t as straightforward as it used to be, opening these bank accounts is always worth the effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the bottom line is, there are a plethora of options when it comes to offshore banking. At the same time, there are numerous rules and regulations that you have to bear in mind before settling on a specific country you wish to open your account in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-legal-aspect-of-offshore-banking\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-legal-aspect-of-offshore-banking\"><\/span>The legal aspect of offshore banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you open your offshore bank for online banking, you should steer clear of all the myths pointing to offshore BaaS as a front for illegal dealings. You shouldn\u2019t think of yourself as a villain looking to carry out some shady dealings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth of the matter is, offshore bank accounts are fully legal. People just have to learn to shake off the misconception that these financial institutions exist to aid in money laundering or fronts to illegal or shady dealings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has the right to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.escapeartist.com\/offshore-banking-setup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">open an offshore account<\/a> anytime they wish to, only that you have to ensure it is not a secret. Therefore, if you are thinking of opening an account for purposes of tax evasion, it then becomes illegal. Always ensure, whichever country you\u2019re from, you are complying with the laws of the land in regards to offshore BaaS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to take time to go through and understand the rules and regulations when it comes to offshore banking. When you have a comprehensive understanding of these financial systems work, you will start realising the immense opportunities available that will benefit you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-576\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-you-should-consider-opening-an-offshore-bank-account\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"why-you-should-consider-opening-an-offshore-bank-account\"><\/span>Why you should consider opening an offshore bank account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Experienced financial advisors always warn against putting all your eggs in one basket, which loosely translates to avoiding putting all your wealth in one place. There are a host of reasons why you shouldn\u2019t do this and opt for banking offshore. They include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Reducing political risk<\/strong>: Inasmuch the political systems in the western and European countries have been largely stable, it is only natural for someone with lots of money in the bank to feel anxious, especially with the war on the rich. Therefore, for the sake of peace of mind, go offshore. How federal and local governments have control over local bank accounts is not the same with offshore banking. The process of freezing or seizing foreign banking accounts is significantly harder. Always pick a politically stable country for sanity\u2019s sake.<\/li><li><strong>Asset protection<\/strong>: Because of national debts, governments won\u2019t hesitate looking into people\u2019s personal accounts when push comes to shove. In some countries like Poland, Cyprus and Hungary, they have used people\u2019s personal assets to get out of sticky situations. In some cases, bureaucrats can just freeze your bank account any time they wish. Therefore, to avoid such hassles, it is only prudent to consider offshore banking.<\/li><li><strong>Deposit insurance fund insolvency<\/strong>: One fact that can be quite disturbing about the American FDIC has lower than 1% of deposits in their accounts. Therefore, if every<strong> bank in the US<\/strong> goes under, you will only receive about a $1 for every $300 deposit. To steer clear of such uncertainty, consider foreign banks because they offer deposit insurance, with some being unlimited. You can be sure that you money will stay protected in the occurrence of any unfortunate situation.<\/li><li><strong>Currency diversification<\/strong>: According to <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/31aumny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">James Rickard\u2019s book<\/a>, the western countries are in currency wars, which calls for the need for people to diversify their currency. You can do this by buying gold and silver coins\/bars and steer clear of intrusion from central bankers. You can also choose to go for currencies that local entities wouldn\u2019t bother with. You can choose popular offshore financial institution in countries like Singapore, Hong Kong or <strong>Andorra<\/strong> that work with multiple currencies and work with currencies gaining momentum.<\/li><li><strong>Better interest rates<\/strong>: After diversifying your currencies in foreign accounts, you can enjoy greater interest rates. For instance, some offshore bank accounts can offer up to 10 times greater interest rates than local banks. Furthermore, there are banks offering 11% APY as long as you don\u2019t withdraw money from your account for the stipulated duration.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-open-an-offshore-bank-account\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-you-need-to-open-an-offshore-bank-account\"><\/span>What you need to open an offshore bank account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different banks have different regulations, but in one way or another, the procedures for opening these bank accounts are pretty much the same. Some of the crucial documentation you will need to include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Copy of your passport<\/li><li>Filled-in application form<\/li><li>Proof of address \u2013 utility bill<\/li><li>A letter from your bank showing your average balance and good standing<\/li><li>Proof of investment income<\/li><li>Some banks may ask your expected transaction sizes and transfer frequency<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>P.S<\/em><\/strong><em>: Some of these credentials needed may feel obtrusive but keep in mind that it is because of the jurisdictional pressure from governments around the world to curb funding terrorism, money laundering and tax evasion.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a legal way to protect your wealth from possibly unscrupulous governments or fundamentally unsound banking systems, consider moving a portion of your funds offshore online banking.
