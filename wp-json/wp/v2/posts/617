It is a form of electronic banking service provided by financial institutions, whether banks or <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">payment providers<\/a>, which allow customers to access both financial and non-financial banking features online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, customers don\u2019t have to include running to the bank as part of their daily errands because they can do this from the comfort of their sofa at home. Customers can request for fund transfer or pay their bills or access other essential banking services remotely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some of the most important banking features your online banking should have<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the key banking features that you should enjoy when signing up for banking online to make digital payments:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Up-to-date account activity<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is fundamentally important that your online bank account is up-to-date, with real-time updates. This is key because it will help you always keep updated with your finances because you will easily and regularly review your account activity. Always take note of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The transactions history, including the inflows and outflows like check or direct deposits or ATM cash withdrawals and debit card payments.<\/li><li>The date of each transaction, the transaction value and the description. Ensure that you recognise each of these details to flag anything unfamiliar immediately.<\/li><li>Any transactions on hold or pending to find out why.<\/li><li>Your account balance to always stay in the loop of how much you have remaining.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Ability to check account balance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online banking makes it easier than before to check your account balances online at any time. Therefore, you will be aware of the much you have before you proceed to perform any transaction on your account. Some even just show you your balance without having to log in, saving you the extra step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even as you check your balance online, always take note of the available and current balances. Make sure that you don\u2019t spend more than is in your account because you don\u2019t know the difference between the current balance and the available balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Online bill pay<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration of online bills into online banking platforms has significantly helped in centralising your bills in one place. This ensures that you don\u2019t have to scroll through separate bill accounts every time you want to settle your bills. Therefore, you should easily be able to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Set reminders for any upcoming bill due dates<\/li><li>Create future-dated, one-time or any recurring payments<\/li><li>Add or schedule billers to make payments<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, you can also receive electronic billing statements (eBills) to eco-friendlier and easier account management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Bank account alerts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes life can be too busy and you tend to forget about some things. Therefore, at such points, you need to start setting reminders like bank account alerts for things like daily balance alerts, low account balance alerts and any other transactional alerts. For convenience purposes, online banking will let you receive these alerts via text messages or emails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/common-digital-accounts-international-payments-1.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-585\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/common-digital-accounts-international-payments-1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/common-digital-accounts-international-payments-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/common-digital-accounts-international-payments-1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Fraudulent activity alerts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any bank should let you feel confident that your cash is safe. One of the best security features that come in handy with online banking that is instrumental in ensuring your peace of mind is <a href=\"https:\/\/dollar.bank\/personal\/banking\/credit-debit-cards\/fraud-alerts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fraud alerts<\/a>. They are crucial because they will inform you of any potentially suspicious activity on your bank account. Therefore, you will always know what is happening and you can immediately prevent it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Biometrics security protection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that your <a href=\"https:\/\/dollar.bank\/personal\/banking\/online-mobile-banking\/mobile-banking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internet banking<\/a> experience remains more secure, online banking platforms offer additional security features like facial recognition using Face ID, fingerprint protection using Touch or voice passwords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the important biometrics safeguards that are designed to only add an extra layer of protection but also to make it relatively easy for customers to quickly sign into their accounts without having to type passwords every time they want to log in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Self-service options<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always look out for self-service options among the features of your internet banking partner. This feature is all about banking made easier and convenient on another level. With such a feature, you don\u2019t have to keep calling your bank in case of an issue when you can do it right from your phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Activities like updating contact details, stopping payments, reordering checks or requesting for your personalised debit card can be done straight from your mobile phone or computer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The era of digital payments is here, and every person or business should endeavour to enjoy the online banking features to make life easier. Become one of the growing population of consumers taking advantage of internet banking to enjoy the immense benefits it has to offer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More innovative forms of digital payments are coming up as each day passes by.
