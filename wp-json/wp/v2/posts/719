class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your business is yours, and nobody knows it better than you, and that means you understand your customer\u2019s needs. Choosing the right business banking can be challenging, made more so by the propensity of retail banks to make finer details even more opaque than is necessary. That\u2019s because they have vested financial interests, keeping you reliant on their feature packages than breaking free with account integrations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better care for your customers, identify the services and features you need to incorporate into your business account. Examine integral products through the eyes of your company\u2019s goals to avoid over-integration, which can stunt your ability for growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/business-banking-and-the-internet-today\/\">rise of digital banks<\/a> has provided resources that show banking shouldn\u2019t be separate from payroll, expense management, invoicing, and other crucial business processes. Banking-as-a-service providers incorporate these services into their products to save their consumers time and money. That means you can build your business account using integrations to have everything in one place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"enterprise-bank-account-integrations-guarantee-ease-of-accounting-and-security-of-audit-trails\"><\/span>Enterprise Bank Account Integrations Guarantee Ease of Accounting and Security of Audit Trails<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With your current business account, you can probably access such processes as invoicing or expense management. But these come with additional charges for payroll, access to credit and so forth. Your situation warrants a paid-for plan, which bundles together these services while bringing the cost down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pay for administration software, digital bank, or fintech solutions, they will provide your firm with advanced integrations. That means you can save time that you manually gave to inputting data, relocating that to your company management. For instance, you can build bank account integrations that link your accounting software.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the correct bank account integrations, you can seamlessly integrate the most popular of these, which are;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>QuickBooks<\/li><li>Mint<\/li><li>Quicken<\/li><li>FreshBooks<\/li><li>Wave<\/li><li>Xero<\/li><li>Gusto<\/li><li>Expensify<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Such financial solutions are at hand hassle-free, with automatic payment fees and a wealth of accounting options to choose from. With such integration, you can ensure greater banking transaction accuracy, including processed account reconciliation and automated risk management. You\u2019ll be expediting critical payments, will approve and carry out other transaction activities autonomously or at the click of a button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"should-you-choose-banking-as-a-service-instead-of-integrating-traditional-business-bank-account\"><\/span>Should You Choose Banking as a Service Instead of Integrating Traditional Business Bank Account?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your business bank account separates your enterprise from your other finances in the least complex sense. If your business is a legal entity with limited companies, then having a specialized trade account is required. But even for smallholders or sole proprietors, such accounts assist in keeping cleaner records and ease the submission of self-assessment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the banking space, <a href=\"https:\/\/startups.co.uk\/banking\/best-challenger-bank\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">challenger banks<\/a> or digital and mobile-first entities establish or build bank account integrations for your business more than traditional institutions. Fintech and neo bank operators are characterized by their shared mission to make banking user-controllable and transparent. As portrayed by banking-as-a-service provisions, such features put back the power in your customer\u2019s hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their generalized use of the internet or mobile apps provides unequalled access to your business bank account and its integrations. In the UK, the approval and regulation of these digital banks are overseen by the FCA or Financial Conduct Authority. You can also rest easy since they should also carry insurance protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, FSCS, for the loss of the first \u00a385,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-account-features.jpg\" alt=\"business banking features\" class=\"wp-image-777\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-account-features.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-account-features-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-account-features-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-features-should-you-expect-in-an-integrated-business-bank-account\"><\/span>What Features Should You Expect in an Integrated Business Bank Account?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-built business bank account does more than handle your money and transactions but instead goes the extra mile. Using integrations helps ease administrative burdens while assisting your customers in managing their expenses. Many integration providers add flexible lending services that facilitate cash flow or investment hurdles for the short or long term. It\u2019s up to you to set up the best services while keeping an eye on any hidden charges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the accounting integrations I spoke about earlier, features that build better business bank accounts include;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"additional-cards-or-extra-pay-way-options\"><\/span>Additional Cards or Extra Pay-Way Options<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have more credit cards or <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift.\">digital payment gateways<\/a> like wallets for your employees to use, all linked to your business account. For this, you\u2019ll have a centralized account management system to track expenditure, restrict transactions or add and block cards. These could also be multi-currency to cut back travel exchange mark-ups and other travel costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"online-or-phone-sms-bank-account-access\"><\/span>Online or Phone SMS Bank Account Access<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of digital banks\u2019 functionality, web and SMS access are integrations required nowadays, even for personal banking. That\u2019s where your business account allows you to make fund transfers or pay bills using your desktop, mobile phone, or tablet. Choose accounts that offer services like text alerts or USSD cost-free, which saves on your transaction costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"priority-care-or-business-banking-support\"><\/span>Priority Care or Business Banking Support<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business grows, you don\u2019t have time to wait for typical banking protocols of customer care. Your bank account should have 24\/7 support team availability, especially when you\u2019ve integrated extra <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/\">resources and a management system<\/a>. Digital banks and entities offering banking as a service provide in-app chat functions where your queries are handled almost instantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"instant-invoicing-and-downloadable-csv-exports\"><\/span>Instant Invoicing and Downloadable CSV Exports<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital banking apps offer your business account simplicity when record keeping or tax reporting. It\u2019s easier, with proper integration, to download and share CSV statements straight from your bank to your tax accountant. Besides generating tailored reports and data exportation, you can also track payments and match them with outstanding invoices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"offers-of-flexible-but-sustainable-business-credit\"><\/span>Offers of Flexible but Sustainable Business Credit<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business bank account provider doesn\u2019t have credit facilities that suit your enterprise, they should partner with lenders using seamless integrations. Some offer borrowing against overdrafts as part of extra flexibility or advances to give your enterprise a leg up during cash flow situations. Apart from loans, you\u2019ll also have access to exclusive perks and discounts that help get business up and running.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your business might not require such an extent to build bank account integrations, and it\u2019s up to you to decide what to keep and what to do away with. Avoid an approach to \u2018integrate everything,\u2019 seeing as you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/uk\/business-bank-accounts\/7-tips-to-make-the-most-of-your-business-bank-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">must keep maintenance fees<\/a> to the minimum.

You can have in-built or third-party services that assist with transaction recording, expense management, accounting, reporting, and cloud data storage.
