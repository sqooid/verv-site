It\u2019s a reason that has seen it continue to generate a heated debate in the digital payments niche leading to the emergence of highly confusing opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these opinions have are not only confusing but also highly misleading. Below is a look at what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pingidentity.com\/en\/company\/blog\/posts\/2020\/what-does-passwordless-really-mean.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">passwordless payments<\/a> are, their role in the digital payments system, and what consumers can expect in the coming days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"passwordless-payments-what-are-they\"><\/span>Passwordless Payments: What Are They?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Passwordless identity verification is exactly as its name suggests: it\u2019s a form of identity verification that doesn\u2019t require users to input a password when completing a financial transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It means passwords are never applied as a backup or authentication method and consequently never stored in a password manager or vault. It\u2019s an important point to remember, especially when trying to differentiate between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/blogposting\/18016\/passwordfree-vs-passwordless-authentication-the-vital-differences#:~:text=If%20a%20person%20can%20type,a%20password%20or%20enter%20one.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">password free vs. passwordless authentication.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain tech providers and payment processors claim to use passwordless authentication systems in their digital payment systems when this is not the reality. Such payment processing companies continue to employ passwords as a backup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It leaves the consumers using the financial services vulnerable to password-based attacks as any person can use the stored password to access their account on the payments solution firm. Passwordless authentication in the payments industry helps eliminate the knowledge factor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It introduces an online payment system that\u2019s more secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/passwordless2.jpg\" alt=\"passwordless payments\" class=\"wp-image-242\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/passwordless2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/passwordless2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/passwordless2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-passwordless-payments-can-help-the-industry\"><\/span>How Passwordless Payments Can Help the Industry<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Security of passwordless payments can benefit the digital payments system in several ways:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It Significantly Improves User Experience<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newswire.com\/news\/new-research-most-people-have-70-80-passwords-21103705\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">NordPass<\/a>, a normal person using the internet has an average of seventy to eighty passwords. As things stand, most people have a hard time creating a challenging password to use with a digital payments processor.<br>So, imagine having to memorize up to eighty different passwords! As digital banking goes passwordless, users will no longer need to crack their brains every time they make an online payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question, therefore, becomes, how does this help the payments industry? Businesses will no longer need to worry about consumers abandoning their shopping carts because they can\u2019t remember or don\u2019t want to reset their forgotten passwords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using passwordless payments will offer users a more improved online experience. They will need to input a phone number and wait for the system to send them a generated token code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presently, some apps have begun to accept biometric, e.g., retinal, facial, and fingerprint scans, as sufficient authentication methods helping to provide extra convenience to users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>It Prevents the Takeover of Online Payments Accounts Via Credential Attacks<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of passwordless authentication in a digital payment system will assist in doing away with all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paloaltonetworks.com\/cyberpedia\/what-is-a-credential-based-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">credential-based attacks.<\/a> Hackers will no longer use passwords to access banking and social media accounts as the said passwords will be non-existent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this form of authentication can assist in protecting against login credentials getting leaked or stolen in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u2022 <strong>Phishing attacks<\/strong><br><strong>\u2022 Credential stuffing attacks<br>\u2022 Social engineering attacks<br>\u2022 Ransomware via RDP attacks<br>\u2022 Credential attacks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Passwordless Authentication Strengthen the Cyber Security of Payment Processors<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The cyber security of payments solution providers is highly reliant on the caution exercised by their employees. Depending on their security levels, a leaked password can cause irreparable damage, with attackers getting to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Cause general havoc with company data and systems<br>\u2022 Access the entire company network, including any devices connected to it<br>\u2022 Leak trade secrets<br>\u2022 Access email accounts and even send\/receive messages<br>\u2022 Post offensive messages meant to ruin the company\u2019s reputation on social media<br>\u2022 Access confidential information and files<br>\u2022 Eavesdrop on highly classified internal communications<br>\u2022 Carry out financial fraud<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deployment of a robust password identity verification system will limit the number of people accessing crucial company resources, e.g., laptops and cellphones. Some of the solutions a company can deploy include PKI client certificates with hardware tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Financial Services Providers Get to Reduce Their Costs in the Long Run<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As financial experts continue to look into how passwordless payments can help the industry, it\u2019s becoming clear that they can help reduce long-term security-related costs. Companies don\u2019t need to spend extra on password resets, management, and storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the IT departments get freed up to deal with more pertinent issues as they no longer need to monitor and reset password policies constantly. A<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hypr.com\/hypr-password-study-findings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> 2019 survey report <\/a>from HYPR shows around 78 percent of respondents had to reset passwords within ninety days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers may not know this, but companies typically spend an average of $70 on every password reset request, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.okta.com\/blog\/2019\/08\/how-much-are-password-resets-costing-your-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Okta reports<\/a>.
