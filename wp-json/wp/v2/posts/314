The new normal<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, a payment gateway is a form of merchant service responsible for processing card payments on a digital payment system. Literally speaking, payment gateways are some form of metaphorical register in any online payment. Therefore, to ensure customer satisfaction, it has to be safe and convenient to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, there are a few steps payment gateways take to accomplish the purpose of their financial services :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Encryption: The gateway will secure the data between the customer\u2019s browser and the retailer\u2019s server for exclusive use between a buyer and seller.<br>\u2022 Request: Payment processors will receive an authorization request from the credit card company to allow the transaction to proceed.<br>\u2022 Fulfillment: Upon authorization, the payment gateway will receive the go-ahead to let the site complete the transaction.<br>This is essentially how payment gateway works, inasmuch as it may have some of the other functions like tax cost calculations and screening orders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"are-payment-processors-and-payment-gateways-the-same\"><\/span>Are payment processors and payment gateways the same?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The straight answer is no. However, there are some intricacies you should know to ensure that you are not confused because many people use \u2018processors\u2019 and \u2018gateways\u2019 interchangeably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A payment processor is responsible for analyzing and transmitting transaction data, including information on the issuing bank like links to that bank or the debit\/credit card numbers. On the other hand, the payment gateway architecture essentially authorizes funds transfer between a buyer and seller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about it, the difference is quite subtle, but it\u2019s what makes the real difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-different-types-of-payment-gateway\"><\/span>The different types of payment gateway<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On a general scale, there are three primary types of gateways that you should know:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 On-site payments: Many leading businesses have robust infrastructure to allow for on-site payments handled by their servers. Therefore, when a customer checks out, all the payment processing will be handled by their servers, and you don\u2019t have to leave the site.<br>\u2022 Checkout on-site, pay off-site: A good example here is Stripe\u2019s gateway. In their case, the checkout will occur on-site, but things move to the back end when it comes to payment processing. The advantage of such gateways is mostly simplicity. However, merchants will have to be at the mercy of the state of the gateway.<br>\u2022 Redirects: Take PayPal for example. When a gateway moves a customer to the PayPal payment page for payment processing and paying, this will be a redirect. It is especially suited for small businesses because they can enjoy the security and convenience of a leading platform like PayPal but with less control.<br>Summary of payment gateway list<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are probably already curious about some of these payment gateways that exist today. This section will find a list of the some of the most used payment gateway options for digital payments in the payments industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 PayPal<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/business-account\/#:~:text=Payment%20gateway%20%2D%20Accept%20250%2B%20payment%20methods%20globally%20and%20benefit%20from%20your%20own%20markup%20fees%20for%20every%20transaction.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Verv<\/a><br>\u2022 Stripe<br>\u2022 Apple Pay<br>\u2022 Amazon Pay<br>\u2022 Square<br>\u2022 Authorize.net<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/secure-payment-gateway.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1076\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/secure-payment-gateway.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/secure-payment-gateway-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/secure-payment-gateway-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"some-of-the-payment-gateways-limitations-you-should-know\"><\/span>Some of the payment gateways limitations you should know<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know what is payment gateway with example, you might want to know some of the limitations of using some of these gateways, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 They rarely accept all the payments\/cards: Inasmuch as many gateways say that they are about universality, that\u2019s not always the case. They fail to mention that, in some instances, they won\u2019t accept payments from some processing portals and card issuers.<br>\u2022 Some international shoppers may not have the cross-border payment option: A good example is in China, where they mostly use Alipay, which is not available for US customers. Therefore, merchants wishing to venture into the international market need to ensure that their payment gateway is robust enough to handle it.<br>\u2022 Security flaws (limited): According to reports, more than one-third of customers hesitate to use ecommerce platforms because of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.internetretailer.com\/2015\/02\/03\/online-shoppers-hesitate-buy-because-security-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">security concerns<\/a>. Some gateways are pretty top-tier, but they still face vulnerabilities like mobile payment issues, malware or data breaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-secure-gateway\"><\/span>What to consider when choosing a secure gateway<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing what to expect from a gateway allows you to narrow your focus when choosing a gateway for your business. Because finding a mainstream gateway shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem, this section will focus more on security, and these questions would help:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>What payments methods are your customers using<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important question to ask because you need to find out what your customers are currently using and capitalize on it. Therefore, as you stack gateways, ensure that they accommodate payments they can use so that they run fewer security risks and problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>What fees are involved?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If the money you spend for fraud detection and additional security concerns outweigh the running costs of the platform, then you shouldn\u2019t be using that platform. Look at how their fees relate to your security costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>What is their reputation and encryption<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a visible security mark at checkout? This is an important question because it boots trust among customers. For instance, just the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluefountainmedia.com\/blog\/verisign-seal-increase-conversions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VeriSign seal<\/a> presence on the BlueFountainMedial, their form fills increased by more than 40%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, ensure that you look at the encryption used. Ensure that you work with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/pci-compliance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PCI compliant<\/a> platforms because they ensure that they uphold the necessary security provisions for the digital payments world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a deeper understanding of the functions, prices and security of gateways in the payments industry, you will be at an advantage when it comes to selecting the right gateway for your business needs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The exponential growth of the payments industry is mostly a result of the need for an integrated, multi-channel digital payments strategy.
