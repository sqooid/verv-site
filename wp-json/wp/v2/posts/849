But that\u2019s a standard requirement in a sector disrupting customer-bank relationships aimed at keeping consumers engaged and happy. So, for Verv in the future, the question is what to expect from the pioneering payment product moving on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a staggering pace of change in digital banking, but it isn\u2019t easy to put a measurement on, but predicting its trajectory isn\u2019t hard. The difficulty comes in when you may overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term. But shifts in trends are making traditional banks build apps, and many Fintechs are eliminating the need for physical locations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the current developments in technology, it\u2019s easy to miss the disruption if your focus is on the next quarter or year. For Verv as a pioneering payment solution provider, the future holds exponential digital payment innovation, fragmented across the device, medium, and form factors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div

Consumer habits and preferences provide algorithmic analytics, which can see firms facing increasing complexity as they attempt to reconcile demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a payment solutions provider with capability, such as Verv, it\u2019s about helping our clients and their customers make sense of the fast-changing and complex environment. Our future vision consists of speaking with market leaders to distil their insight for tomorrow\u2019s bold themes. As we advance, payment providers should present the <a href=\"https:\/\/web-assets.bcg.com\/7c\/e0\/596af1214f32820093f1f88c05f0\/bcg-global-payments-2020-fast-forward-into-the-future-oct-2020-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fabric ecosystem complexity<\/a> in a simplified form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"payment-solutions-based-on-blockchain-banking-and-smart-contracts\"><\/span>Payment Solutions Based on Blockchain Banking and Smart Contracts<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/blockchain-and-payment-processors-640x285-1.jpg\" alt=\"blockchain and payment processors\" class=\"wp-image-852\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/blockchain-and-payment-processors-640x285-1.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/blockchain-and-payment-processors-640x285-1-300x134.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/blockchain-and-payment-processors-640x285-1-416x185.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The core technology behind cryptos and decentralised finance, DeFi, Blockchain is a P2P or peer-to-peer distributed network. Banks have started to seriously consider this process as it\u2019s faster, efficient, and less prone to error than traditional ACH or automatic clearinghouse transfers. They save time and money, but customers and business-to-business or B2B partners receive remittances almost instantaneously despite the country of payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decentralised nature of <a href=\"https:\/\/verv.novatti.com\/simplifying-the-complexity-of-payments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blockchain is a booster for security<\/a>, seeing as the complexity of hacks and traceability of transactions deter fraudsters. An element of Blockchain banking, smart contracts allow customers to make cash, property, shares, or any asset exchanges. It defines and enforces agreements in a conflict-free, secure way without a go-between or third party entity taking a cut.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"pioneering-agility-for-encapsulation-contextualisation-programming-and-democratising-of-payments\"><\/span>Pioneering: Agility for Encapsulation, Contextualisation, Programming and Democratising of Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Verv is coping with abstracting complexity away from our customer-specific processes to be a future fit for our payment solutions consumers. Everything is going through disruption, including money, and managing the evolution of payments remains our core objective.<br>That\u2019s because, in the future, the payment solutions fabric is to become;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"encapsulated-and-enriched-with-the-wrapped-value\"><\/span>Encapsulated and Enriched With the Wrapped Value<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The embedded finance product trend will mean payment technology wraps value around a transaction, distributing it to all points of need. That parameter of enriched data lives within the payment, automated, transparent, and reconciled or encapsulated. If a process reports state changes, its attribution triggers multiparty loyalty or micropayments. That places simplified components at checkout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"contextualised-with-consistent-authentication-as-an-in-a-box-solution\"><\/span>Contextualised With Consistent Authentication as an In-A-Box Solution<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI rules localise authentication, such as geo-location, device fingerprinting, and behavioural biometrics, minimal customer intervention will be necessary. That consistent authorisation is contextualised where Verv, a payments technology provider, offers in-a-box solutions. The <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/digital-banking-explained-all-you-need-to-know\/\">basic principle of payment control and wrapped value-added services<\/a> reside within a transaction, component or device, managed remotely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"democratised-and-affordable-to-everyone\"><\/span>Democratised and Affordable to Everyone<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless we can translate to low-tech ecosystems, digital payments won\u2019t supplant all earlier form factors, meaning they\u2019ll not serve all customers. Migrating the under-banked populations and lower entry costs to financial services, regulators insist on available finance and interoperability. Digital currency payments offer inclusivity while providing a means for government fund distribution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"programmable-payments-with-self-enacting-rules\"><\/span>Programmable Payments with Self-Enacting Rules<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For device-agnostic payment payloads, tokenised transactions set conditions of operations to restrict merchant services, location, values, or times. Programmable payments come equipped with their rules enabling autonomous transfers or machine-to-machine settlements. Verv builds the Blockchain framework with which your entity will settle payments with on-device ledgers, CBDCs, or stable coins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"payment-solutions-and-innovation-shift-from-consumers-to-businesses\"><\/span>Payment Solutions and Innovation Shift from Consumers to Businesses<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last ten years were about bridging consumers with mobile payment solutions, but the next decade belongs to autonomous payments in connected devices for businesses. As a payment provider determined to offset complexity, Verv\u2019s scenario-based solution is one of re-bundling and fragmentation orchestration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than embedded payment technology, we unbundle valuable services from payments and shift our strategy to focus on vertical and horizontal services of specialisation and simplification. These reassembling capabilities see us as aggregators and orchestrators specialising in between payment layers. Our payment-as-a-service solutions are anchored around the value of transactions for firms, developers, and device customers, differentiating and avoiding becoming a utility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"spearheading-the-shift-towards-control-over-payments\"><\/span>Spearheading the Shift towards Control over Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The future is peppered with decentralised enablement, transparency traceability, and event-driven payments. As everything, including vehicles, becomes connected devices, the need for <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/business-opportunies-with-banking-as-a-service-baas\/\">embedded ledgers and autonomous transaction<\/a> capabilities rises. That\u2019s because soon to come is an era where scale will matter as platforms build their payment networks and interoperable consortia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect the follow-ups of the European Payments Initiative and P27, which are precursors of the age of interoperable open finance. Meeting these evolving regulatory changes while fulfilling customer expectations is part of Verv\u2019s mission to transform global payments. We operate in over 40 countries, providing 250 plus payment platforms and supporting API-driven architectures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"joining-the-winners-circle-at-capitalising-on-future-trends-in-payment-processing\"><\/span>Joining the Winner\u2019s Circle at Capitalising on Future Trends in Payment Processing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The evolution of innovation and proliferation of payment systems helps us decide how to focus our efforts in the future, leveraging on the upward trends.
