This was a result of the economic slowdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inasmuch as governments tried introducing regulatory measures like monetary and fiscal stimulus, there wasn\u2019t much that they achieved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there was a sudden upsurge in digital payments because of the increased digitization of consumer and commercial transactions. Such sudden growth was instrumental in adding to the upward momentum than was expected, especially in 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-were-the-global-numbers-looking-like\"><\/span>What were the global numbers looking like?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/industries\/financial-services\/our-insights\/global-payments-2021-transformation-amid-turbulent-undercurrents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5% decline in the payment revenues from 2019 to 2020<\/a>. This wasn\u2019t the expected trend as experienced between 2014 and 2019. These numbers were fairly intuitive, at least on the surface. However, some granular analysis shows that there were several offsetting trends underlying.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a broad scale, the digital financial services sector remained resilient to the economic changes despite many countries spending a huge chunk of their economic calendars under lockdown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping this in mind, you can forecast that there will be some primary drivers that will influence the trajectory of the payments industry and the payments regulation. Furthermore, the return to normalcy and post-COVID economic growth will certainly play an instrumental role in accelerating the upward trend experienced in 2021, even as 2022 fast approaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1.jpg\" alt=\"Payments Regulation\" class=\"wp-image-219\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-is-the-future-of-payments-trends-with-this-in-mind\"><\/span>What is the future of payments trends with this in mind?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping the above information in mind, it is safe to project that the global payment numbers will return to normalcy: the 6-7% growth. This means that economies will start recouping the previous years\u2019 returns in 2022. These numbers are projected to reach about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/gx\/en\/industries\/financial-services\/publications\/financial-services-in-2025\/payments-in-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$2.5 trillion come 2025<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, even as more financial institutions continue to absorb digital payments in their journey to recovery, the already established payment processors will enjoy greater access to fantastic opportunities. Therefore, FinTech companies will enjoy the dominance in 2022 since this area isn\u2019t largely regulated yet. This is because of the attractive payments value chain and not the conventional interchange in payment flows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"will-the-growing-regulatory-framework-for-digital-payments-be-of-benefit\"><\/span>Will the growing regulatory framework for digital payments be of benefit?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The continued increase in the number of payment processing firms, especially in 2021, have significantly affected cross-border payments. However, the collapse of a digital payment system like Wirecard AG in 2020 resulted in questions on the need for jurisdictions in the oversight and regulation of the digital payments industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Chair of the SSM\u2019s Supervisory Board in 2020 contended that the rise of online payment solutions on a non-stringent regulatory regime could call for more deliberations by different regulatory bodies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This suggests that there is a need for regulation to ensure that there is financial stability while ensuring customer protection. However, even with this in mind, there should be no compromise on any other policy objectives like the promoting innovation and financial inclusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_2.jpg\" alt=\"Payments Regulation\" class=\"wp-image-221\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"some-of-the-regulatory-requirements-to-expect-in-2022-onwards\"><\/span>Some of the regulatory requirements to expect in 2022 onwards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bis.org\/fsi\/publ\/insights33.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">regulatory requirement<\/a>s you can expect to see in the foreseeable future of payments regulations include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Safeguards to ensure funds remain safe:<\/strong> Inasmuch as this is a common requirement, there is a greater concern for non-bank financial services to ensure that they reinforce this aspect.<br>\u2022 <strong>Interoperability:<\/strong> It falls among the least common regulations, but its enforcement in 2022 when it comes to digital payments will be vital. Therefore, different payment processors will be required to adopt some common standard during their operations to ensure interoperability.<br>\u2022 <strong>Cyber security and risk management:<\/strong> There is a need for risk management aspects like internal controls to be uniform across the board, especially for any payments solution in future of payments regulation. This will go a long way in ensuring operational resilience. On the other hand, there is a need to find common ground for cyber security policies. These policies have to be in tandem with the payment processor\u2019s business characteristics to ensure customer safety online in tandem in the future of payments regulation.<br>\u2022 <strong>Data protection: <\/strong>There is a need to update the current data protection laws for them to cover the payments industry fully. These laws should cut across the different financial transaction institutions. They should out rightly define consent when it comes to data transfer or processing. Furthermore, there will be a need to explicitly define sensitive data like personal information so that no third parties get access.<br>\u2022 <strong>Consumer protection:<\/strong> Many firms will move to dedicate more on the consumer protection requirements. This means that more FinTech companies will ensure explicit rules specific to the digital payments industry. Also, it will be paramount that payment processors disclose transaction fees to their customers.<br>Exploring the new opportunities in digital payments and regulations<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the rapid growth of the payments industry, there is a continued push for online identity verification systems. This ensures that, even with the growing volumes of users globally, consumers continue feeling safe while making payments online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, cross-border payments will proliferate, which will call for an increased level of regulation and identity checks to ensure that there are no chances of financial crimes by ill-minded individuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_3.jpg\" alt=\"Payments Regulation\" class=\"wp-image-222\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_regulation_3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As 2021 comes to an end, there will be a need for regulators in the digital payments space to pay particular attention to the popular FinTech companies on a global scale to ensure oversight because these firms can easily reach a wider audience when it comes to the future of payments regulation.
