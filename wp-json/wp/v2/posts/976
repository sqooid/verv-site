The merchant account is simply an account capable of accepting credit card payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The payment gateway acts as a link between the online store\/website and the merchant account. As you continue with your research into payment gateways, there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How much do the payment processors charge in terms of transaction and merchant fees?<\/li><li>Is there a list of products that I can\u2019t sell via the said gateway? For example, certain processors won\u2019t allow merchants to use their platforms to sell guns.<\/li><li>Does the gateway charge different rates for different credit debit cards? For example, are there cards that attract higher transaction fees than others?<\/li><li>Which countries does the gateway support?<\/li><li>What are the applicable rates and fees for all back-office payments?<\/li><li>How does the company address customer complaints?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce vendors have tons of gateways to choose from today.

Read on to learn how the payment gateways work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-do-the-digital-payments-systems-work\"><\/span>How Do the Digital payments Systems Work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-781\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you can learn how payment processors work, you should start by getting an idea of what they are and what they do. In this case, an online payment system refers to a process that facilitates the payment of goods and services purchased online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The systems typically comprise the merchant account, payment processor, and payment gateway. Here\u2019s a little more information on how they work to assist in simplifying things for you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I. Payment Gateway: As seen earlier, gateways are go-betweens between a payment processor and a merchant account. It\u2019s tasked with handling the technical aspects of the cardholder information transfer. It ensures that each transaction gets completed securely and quickly.<br><\/li><li>II. Payment Processor: They\u2019re essentially third parties whose job is to manage the card transaction process. Their job is to communicate the client\u2019s card details with their bank and the merchant bank. Payment will only complete if they have enough funds in the account.<br><\/li><li>III. Merchant Account: As mentioned earlier, it\u2019s a unique bank that accepts all card payments. eCommerce vendors can\u2019t accept digital payments without this account. It\u2019s why you need to register for one as soon as possible.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These elements work together to handle the transaction from start to finish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-type-of-transactions-handled-by-a-payment-gateway\"><\/span>The Type of Transactions Handled by a Payment Gateway<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before looking at how a business can integrate an <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/international-payments-local-vs-digital-banking\/#:~:text=growth%20in%20the-,international,-payments%20sector%20and\">international payment solution<\/a> into its website, you should look into the types of transactions present. Your business type will influence the one you\u2019ll pick for use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Authorization:<\/strong> Its purpose is to determine whether a client can pay for the goods or services ordered. It will terminate the fund transfer if the card doesn\u2019t have enough funds.<br><\/li><li><strong>Refund:<\/strong> Several processes occur in the background. If a cancellation has to occur for any reason, the merchant has no option but to refund the funds deducted. Refunds only apply to Sale and Capture types of transactions.<br><\/li><li><strong>Capture:<\/strong> It enables the merchant to capture the funds that were previously authorized by the client and transmit them for settlement. It typically applies to products ordered online that took a long time to ship or manufacture.<br><\/li><li><strong>Void:<\/strong> It\u2019s quite similar to refund transactions. However, they only apply when a given transaction hasn\u2019t been settled. It should disappear from a client\u2019s card statement within twenty-four hours.<br><\/li><li><strong>Sale:<\/strong> Such transactions tend to combine captures and authorizations. You should only use it when a transaction gets fulfilled immediately. It works well for businesses selling services and can provide user access immediately after the transfer has occurred.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"types-of-payment-gateways\"><\/span>Types of Payment Gateways<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know what payment gateways are and their role in handling digital payments, it\u2019s time you learned about the available types. Take your time to understand what the market offers before settling on a particular type.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Presently, there are three <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/business\/what-is-a-payment-gateway\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">types of gateways<\/a>: hosted, non-hosted, and custom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-hosted-payment-gateways-and-applicable-examples\"><\/span>1. Hosted Payment Gateways and Applicable Examples<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These gateways will redirect the client from the eCommerce portal to make a payment. Once done, they will transfer them back to your site to proceed with the checkout process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most business owners love them as they are easy to integrate and will usually handle all security aspects. The downside is that you won\u2019t have control over the payment process, which means you might lose a client if they get distracted and opt to head elsewhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the international payment systems examples of hosted gateways include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PayPal<\/li><li>Amazon Pay<\/li><li>Stripe<\/li><li>SagePay<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-integrated-non-hosted-payment-gateways-and-applicable-examples\"><\/span>2. Integrated\/ Non-Hosted Payment Gateways and Applicable Examples<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to lose control over the process, you may want to consider using payment processors that can smoothly integrate into your website. Such gateways will also keep the customer on your platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While smooth integration is their main selling point, there\u2019s the issue of security. The merchant must handle fraud prevention, PCI compliance, and secure cardholder information storage.<br>International payment systems examples of non-hosted gateways include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Authorize.net<\/li><li>SagePay Direct Integration<\/li><li>MangoPay<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-custom-payment-gateways-for-ecommerce-ventures\"><\/span>3. Custom Payment Gateways for eCommerce Ventures<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While there exist many payment gateways, you may want to develop one from scratch. They provide various integration methods and a full shopping experience to their customers. Large companies, for example, are more likely to benefit from custom solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such solutions enable them to break away from any restrictions placed by the vendor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-process-of-building-custom-payment-processorsgateways\"><\/span>The Process of Building Custom Payment Processors\/Gateways<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The creation process requires the merchant to complete a series of steps: the first is to register with a credit company through the bank you intend to use when acquiring the card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I. Contract banks that serve as payment processors to deal with the processing aspect.<\/li><li>II. Start developing an API, ensuring you provide strong documentation for it.<\/li><li>III. Develop a tokenization solution to serve as a fraud protection measure.<\/li><li>IV. Ensure the application becomes PCI DSS compliant.<\/li><li>V. Put in place additional payment channels, e.g., mobile wallets and bitcoin.<\/li><li>VI. Develop a web application to assist in administering merchant operations.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies that don\u2019t want to develop from scratch can use open-source applications. Using open-sourced payment processors will significantly reduce engineering costs. However, it may restrict customization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of a custom international payment solution include customization, low transaction fees, and the chance to offer the gateway as a product. Such solutions work well for large enterprises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The world\u2019s most popular digital wallet is about to change the way we pay for services and goods online.
