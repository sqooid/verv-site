As a result, there is widespread adoption of digital finance and payments, which is set to create new jobs and increase the GDP of emerging economies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been achieved through the reduction of transaction costs and increased access to financial services. As a result, businesses worldwide now have access to reliable payment platforms to help them run businesses at a low cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy1.jpg\" alt=\"connected economy\" class=\"wp-image-271\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>E-commerce<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no eCommerce with the absence of digital payment systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce has offered economic benefits to many individuals and countries. Ecommerce is part of the reasons why economic trade is growing at a significant pace. In addition, it has brought the momentum to strengthen the connected economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is by enhancing trade quality, increasing transparency in the connected economy, decreasing transaction costs, and increasing trade opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As eCommerce becomes stronger, digital payment systems continue to be a critical part of this economy as an enabler. For instance, a platform like <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/business-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Verv offers merchants over 250 options<\/a> to settle payments through its payment gateway. Digital payments have provided businesses globally to establish credit history, which has helped them acquire loans and financial support to expand and grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Compliance<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital payments systems are enabling the connected economy by supporting the formalization of businesses in new jurisdictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reporting requirements and penalties for non-compliance are among the factors that make trading in a connected economy challenging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an increased need for transparency to increase investor confidence as such businesses are required to tackle money laundering, tax evasion, and other financial crimes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-compliance to tax regulations and financial laws in different jurisdictions could lead to a reputation breach, fines, and operational restrictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How have digital payment systems helped to address this?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital applications and networks have supported the payment of license fees, filing taxes, and formalizing businesses across different jurisdictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy2.jpg\" alt=\"connected economy\" class=\"wp-image-272\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Access to Credit<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit increases spending, hence the income levels of an economy.

Time and location constraints no longer hinder consumers from purchasing goods from merchants and transactions between B2B enterprises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The speed and efficiency of running businesses have improved through instant payment, thus strengthening the global economy.<br>Cyberattacks have been a significant challenge in traditional global payments systems. However, digital payment systems have addressed these challenges through strategies like tokenization, encryption, and SSL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secure and faster transaction has boosted the flow of transactions and enhanced cash flow health in the connected economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy3.jpg\" alt=\"connected economy\" class=\"wp-image-273\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/economy3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take Away<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital payment systems play a vital role in enhancing cash flow and operations for businesses in the global economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It plays an instrumental role in addressing challenges such as financial inclusion, access to credit, delayed payments, and financial security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce is playing a vital role in the growth of the connected economy, and digital payment systems power it.
