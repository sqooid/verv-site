It is because of banks that you can take out loans, deposit your paycheck or set up your savings accounts. But do you really understand the concept of banking and the banking system?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, a <strong>banking system<\/strong> is a combination of networks of financial institutions that came together to offer financial services to their customers, including digital payments. Furthermore, they are mandated to operate conventional and digital payments systems alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"functions-of-different-banking-systems\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"functions-of-different-banking-systems\"><\/span>Functions of different banking systems<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Banking systems are responsible for performing a variety of functions, which mostly depend on the kind of network of financial institutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example is the loan and payment functions at commercial banks that make it possible to deposit your funds and, at the same time, utilize your debit cards or checking accounts to pay your bills online. That is even digital payments in <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">cross-border sales<\/a> is very possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, central banks like the Federal Reserve in the USA distribute currency while establishing monetary policies. On the other hand, investments banking systems are charged with the responsibility of carrying out trades or dealing with capital markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also important to keep in mind that a lot of digital payments systems are profit-seeking entities with stockholders. These banks gather profits by charging higher interest for loans while paying less on deposits. For instance, a bank can charge a 3.91% interest rate for a fixed-rate mortgage running for 30 years but the same bank offers only a 0.15% interest rate on a savings account of $100,000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-different-types-of-banks-you-should-know\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-different-types-of-banks-you-should-know\"><\/span>The different types of banks you should know<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the USA, there are a plethora of banking institutions. Inasmuch as they used to be distinctively different, there are more or less the same nowadays. However, these are some of the common types of banks you should know:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Commercial banks<\/strong>: These kinds of were initially setup to offer financial services for businesses. They may include community banks and they accept deposits while offering business and consumer loans. Apart from the conventional services like offering loans, they can also offer investment, retirement and insurance services.<\/li><li><strong>Savings banks<\/strong>: These banks are responsible for providing a place of individuals and entities to save their funds for a rainy day.<\/li><li><strong>Savings and loans banks<\/strong>: These financial institutions were established to help businesses and individuals to grow their businesses or own homes.<\/li><li><strong>Credit unions<\/strong>: These are unique banks created by people or entities sharing a common bond like living or working in the same area to ensure that they can access emergency loans to those who aren\u2019t able to access loans from the conventional lenders.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/online-purchases-1-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-563\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/online-purchases-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/online-purchases-1-300x158.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/online-purchases-1-768x403.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/online-purchases-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"advantages-of-banking-on-the-internet-in-the-usa\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"advantages-of-banking-on-the-internet-in-the-usa\"><\/span>Advantages of banking on the internet in the USA<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fintechreview.net\/top-neobanks-in-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Online banking<\/a> in the US has experienced rapid growth primarily because of convenience. You can easily perform any bank transaction like funds transfer and bill payments from anywhere at any time of the day without having to visit your local branch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, banking on the internet is fast and efficient. You can transfer funds or pay bills almost instantly. Also, it is possible to open or close your bank account online, whether it is a fixed deposits account or a recurring deposit account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, customers can easily and regularly monitor their bank accounts to ensure safety. Therefore, such real-time access makes it easy for customers in the USA to detect any form of fraudulent activity online, which acts as a safeguard against financial loss or damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"disadvantages-of-online-banking\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"disadvantages-of-online-banking\"><\/span>Disadvantages of online banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For beginners in the online banking sector, it might be quite challenging to get a hang of things. Therefore, such persons may end up preferring face-to-face transactions in a brick-and-mortar bank rather than online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may not be entirely possible to access larger sums of money online. For instance, most debit cards come with transactions limits, which may force customers to visit a local branch for them to access the rest of the money they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as digital payment systems are constantly improving their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/how-to-protect-your-online-banking-information\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">security parameters<\/a>, they still remain vulnerable to attacks from malicious individuals. Therefore, it is advisable for customers to avoid using public networks when carrying out financial transactions to ensure that there is no form of unauthorised access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, banking on the internet relies on a reliable internet connection. Therefore, in the event of connectivity issues, it can be quite challenging for customers to decipher whether their transactions have been processed or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as most banks have physical branches, there are banks that operate exclusively online.
