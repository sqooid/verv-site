The growth in digital payment technologies has made cross border payments grow exponentially, especially with the advent of Blockchain technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any digital payment processing service, Blockchain technology will be an integral part of the journey, especially in the resolution of inefficiencies while ensuring payments security in cross-border transactions. At the same time this will enable transactions to become faster and cheaper. However, is this technology vital when it comes to securing cross-border payments? Read on to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_1.jpg\" alt=\" payments security\" class=\"wp-image-225\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-are-cross-border-payments-and-what-are-the-challenges\"><\/span>What are cross border payments, and what are the challenges?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, cross-border payments are international payments that are not restricted by national boundaries. However, conducting cross-border payments via established financial transaction institutions like banks could prove challenging because they involve a lot of intermediaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if a company X in the UK wants to send some funds to company Y in Russia, company X will request company Y\u2019s payment details to initiate the transfer. However, the UK company has to work with a UK bank to work with a correspondent bank in Russia to facilitate the payment. The Russian bank will then send the funds to company Y. That is essentially how cross border payments work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such processes take a lot of time and money before they come to completion. Therefore, the result of such processes is a frustrating and overpriced bottleneck in the payments industry. Payments security as well becomes a factor of concern when so many &#8216;players&#8217; are involved to process a single transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"blockchain-and-the-cross-border-payments-ecosystem\"><\/span>Blockchain and the cross border payments ecosystem<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology is pretty instrumental in streamlining the contactless payments processes and adding an extra layer of payments security. Furthermore, the technology stores any form of financial transaction in a secure digital ledger. It eradicates the element of middlemen in the business. Therefore, there won\u2019t be any hassles, delays, or unnecessary transaction fees in cross border payments and digital currencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, you have to keep in mind that it immediately becomes irreversible once any payment is made on the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, any Blockchain-based payments come with significant advantages, especially for businesses. They are cost-effective, secure, and almost immediate. That is why cooperative oversight is vital. For example, in a typical bank transaction, it would take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yesbank.in\/digital-banking\/tech-for-change\/financial-services\/impact-on-realtime-cross-border-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2-3 business days <\/a>to complete a transfer instead of just seconds for Blockchain payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_2.jpg\" alt=\" payments security\" class=\"wp-image-226\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-security-of-payments-and-the-future-of-blockchain\"><\/span>The security of payments and the future of Blockchain<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Evidently, Blockchain has a promising payments future, especially in ensuring cross-border payments security. This is because the system utilizes encrypted distributed ledgers, which offer trusted real-time verification of all the transactions minus the intermediaries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, you can easily verify payments without depending on third parties. This doesn\u2019t only ensure there\u2019s security but also doesn\u2019t affect the concept of banking. Banks can even integrate digital payment technologies to make their payment processing systems better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the central bank maintains all the records, they can easily face interference in the event it is taken offline, damaged, or hacked. Therefore, the customers\u2019 data is safe with cross border payments and digital currencies. But with Blockchain technology, all records held are secured by cryptography. The records are then tied to a previous transaction, which is then distributed to other participants in a ledger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, with cross border payments with Blockchain, a hacker, before tampering with the information, will have to go through the pain of changing the information on previous transactions in that ledger. This makes the technology practically impenetrable and adding a significant layer of extra fortification when it comes to strengthening the scope of payments security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"getting-over-existing-challenges-with-blockchain\"><\/span>Getting over existing challenges with Blockchain<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross border payments with digital currencies are different from conventional methods like SWIFT. However, even SWIFT\u2019s global payments innovation (GPI) depends on similar unidirectional messaging. Therefore, their systems are independent of any payments and settlements process in the payment industy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where hackers find loopholes to manipulate the system. With blockchain, such <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.oracle.com\/financialservices\/post\/how-blockchain-works-in-cross-border-payments-#:~:text=A%20Blockchain%20is%20a%20digital%20record%20of%20transactions.&amp;text=The%20future%20of%20Blockchain%20technology,intermediaries%20such%20as%20correspondent%20banks.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">challenges and trends are limite<\/a>d. With instant settlements because of the bidirectional messaging, all transactions occur via the transacting party\u2019s ledger. In case no transactions happen, it will notify both parties that the payment wasn\u2019t successful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using digital assets will be an ideal way for financial services institutions to convert their funds to any currency in an instant. Furthermore, banks can securely source liquidity for payments across borders, and it will be cheaper for them. At the same time, since they are done in real-time, it would aid in reducing payment processing institutions\u2019 exposure to forex volatility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_3.jpg\" alt=\" payments security\" class=\"wp-image-227\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_security_3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-does-verv-utilise-blockchain\"><\/span>How does Verv Utilise Blockchain?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Verv we go one step further.
