In the UK, they register with the <strong>Financial Conduct Authority<\/strong> (FCA) and OCC in the US. Your bank brings suspicion if it isn\u2019t registered. An operation license is the confirmation of registration. It is important because, before registration, the bodies will check whether the bank can handle finances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registration is also to verify whether they can run a bank. A bank won\u2019t be registered when people planning to register it lack the appropriate capacity to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"does-that-bank-have-any-history-of-failure\"><\/span>Does That Bank Have Any History of Failure<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check if the bank you plan to work with has any history of going bankrupt.

Is the bank a takeover from a previous failed <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/why-traditional-banks-need-financial-technology\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"147\">financial institution<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a bank is a takeover, it means that after it failed, a more prominent bank with higher financial muscles bought it. Other banks prefer to rebrand to their names while others offer financial assistance, but it is under them. Research about your bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"is-the-bank-risk-factor-guidelines-2021-compliant\"><\/span>Is the bank Risk Factor Guidelines 2021 Compliant<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Check if the bank had a good score on the <a href=\"https:\/\/thepaypers.com\/digital-identity-security-online-fraud\/eba-publishes-guidelines-on-mltf-risk-factors--1247483\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risk factor guidelines 2021<\/a>.

They employ qualified technical personnel to protect the savers. They also invest in physical security measures like CCTVs and police guards on ATMs and banking halls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks ensure the Security of their customers by keeping them up to date through text messages and emails on changes. These changes may include location, phone numbers, and services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-do-banks-protect-your-money\"><\/span>How do Banks Protect Your Money<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deposits and payments are made at the bank. However, the bank plays a disguised role in ensuring that all clients get paid, even in robbery or bankruptcy cases. The bank does this by insuring money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank deposits are insured on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fdic.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Deposits Insurance Corp FDIC<\/a>, which covers the principal and any interest you owe up to $250,000 in total balances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-do-banks-secure-online-transactions\"><\/span>How do Banks Secure Online Transactions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides enjoying the benefits of saving money in a bank, money is kept in banks to enjoy quick payment options like NTFS. With millions of online transactions ranging from online buying to cash withdrawal at ATMs, banks must ensure that customers are safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, banks use a variety of measures to achieve safety in online transactions;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Anti-virus and anti-malware programs ensure intrusion by strange and harmful viruses doesn\u2019t happen. Banks invest in the latest and most reliable, up-to-date programs.<\/li><li>Cookies &#8211; are like prints that one leaves when they visit a place. So cookies signify that a person visited a website on a particular device. When the same login information is used on another browser, it will need verification again.<\/li><li>Authenticator options \u2013 using an ATM may need one authenticating option: the PIN. However, when you log into a bank website, they may need to verify if the owner is accessing the account. They may use multi-factor authentication, including the password, a code sent to the attached phone number, and maybe be asked to answer set security questions. Many banks have now adopted fingerprint, Face ID, and voice authentication options which have boosted the security of a client\u2019s access.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newstatesman.com\/politics\/2013\/04\/banking-confidentiality-still-important\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Confidentiality<\/a> \u2013 your credentials are only known to you and the bank. The banks ensure safety by not sharing it with anyone. Therefore, it\u2019s your responsibility to ensure you don\u2019t share or expose them to the wrong people.<\/li><li>Liability \u2013 your bank follows the trend of your spending. For example, if you pay three people each $400 per month. Your bank will flag any transaction that wants to make a payment of $10,000 to a single person until you verify.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"why-is-it-important-for-banks-to-protect-your-money\"><\/span>Why is it Important For Banks to Protect Your Money<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks protect your money because that is where they profit. Yes, that is what actually happens. Why would they protect someone\u2019s money and they are not making anything? They get a license to protect your money. However, if also do it to protect the interest, any losses will be paid for and will need accountability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks are regulated to ensure no malicious transactions occur. They report on all the bank\u2019s transactions to alert any money laundering and tax evasion cases. This is why they will not just flag your account for trying to send an \u201cabnormal\u201d amount of money but also when you receive an \u201cabnormal\u201d amount of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-to-protect-your-bank-account-from-hackers\"><\/span>How to Protect Your Bank Account From Hackers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, it is not always about the bank securing your funds. As the owner, you play a fundamental role in ensuring that hackers have no access to your account. These guidelines are some of the ways to protect your account from hackers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use a strong password \u2013 always have a password that won\u2019t be the hacker\u2019s first and correct guess. Have a long password (at least eight characters) with a mix of numbers, upper and lowercase, and other non-alphanumeric symbols.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/how-to-protect-your-online-banking-information\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Enable multi-authenticator<\/a> \u2013 don\u2019t use your password only to access your account but enable either a text message or phone call to confirm access to your account. This will always keep you alert whenever someone tries to access your account. You can also utilize fingerprint, face identification, and voice recognition options.<\/li><li>Ensure tabs are closed \u2013 when you finish your transaction, remember to close your browsing tabs. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it is a personal computer or phone; always close tabs.<\/li><li>Don\u2019t share your credentials \u2013 we cannot emphasize enough this. As banks ensure that your information is not shared, could you not share it? Keep your passwords private. If you fear forgetting passwords, use a password manager that connects to your email.<\/li><li>Input account details on secure websites \u2013 websites that are not secured are dangerous because scammers can use them to record details of visitors and then end up stealing from them. Safe websites have HTTPS\/\/, the s at the end stands for secure.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-internet-and-banking\"><\/span>The Internet and Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The growth in internet usage has been a significant boost in the banking arena. However, banks and clients must work together to secure funds. Banks will need to sensitive clients about any update on their application or website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, how banks ensure security solely depends on the customer sometimes. Sensitizing a customer is possible. However, the customer decides whether to take the option.
