It?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization in the digital payments sector involves providing a valuable product or service to a client based on existing data. It can also be based on individual experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When executed correctly, it can assist banking as a <strong>service business<\/strong> to build trust with their clients. In the long run, this will enable them to drive new traffic to the company resulting in increased revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this to happen, baas providers need to develop an experience that integrates operational data collected from call centres, mobile apps, and physical branches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, personalization in online banking can allow an organization to provide its clients with a solution before the client realizes that they need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, personalization in the digital payments sector isn&#8217;t a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lizfrazierpeck\/2021\/03\/22\/digital-banking-trends-evolve-in-2021-but-customer-needs-stay-the-same\/?sh=4a081c6b1cd3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new trend<\/a>. Most experts consider it a reimagining of banking technology that brought clients to financial institutions before the advent of mass marketing.<br>Years ago, consumers visited physical branches where they were on a first-name basis with the tellers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"banking-future-and-the-benefits-of-personalization-in-banking-as-a-service\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"banking-future-and-the-benefits-of-personalization-in-banking-as-a-service\"><\/span>Banking Future and the Benefits of Personalization in Banking as a Service<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last few years have seen the <strong>financial markets become more transactional.<\/strong> It&#8217;s no longer about the relationships that customers have with branch tellers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Todays&#8217; consumers want to know which baas provider has the best reward systems and don&#8217;t charge account maintenance fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a bid to reduce costs, the personalized nature of the banking system underwent some changes. For many, this turned out to be a huge missed opportunity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers are now looking for advice and valuable insight from their online banking service providers. But banks cannot offer this advice as they lack enough information about a client&#8217;s priorities or goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesfinancecouncil\/2020\/10\/09\/data-driven-personalization-reaches-a-tipping-point-in-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">personalized banking<\/a> seeks to help. Apart from boosting the revenue collected from the digital payments systems, personalization offers other benefits such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Increased engagement and conversion rates<br>\u2022 Enhanced customer experience<br>\u2022 Stronger marketing ROI<br>\u2022 Better customer retention rates<br>\u2022 Consistent messaging across all the personalized banking channels<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"personalized banking\" class=\"wp-image-266\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-1024x538.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-300x158.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-768x403.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"types-of-personalized-banking-that-baas-providers-can-offer\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"types-of-personalized-banking-that-baas-providers-can-offer\"><\/span>Types of Personalized Banking That Baas Providers Can Offer<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a general point of view, there are three main types of personalization that digital payments providers can employ:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theyec\/2021\/02\/26\/eight-things-machine-learning-can-do-to-improve-your-daily-customer-interactions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Machine-Learning Personalization:<\/a> It relies on intelligent machine learning algorithms. Teams can use AI-driven automation to make informed decisions on how to reach banking as a service client based on their behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Real-Time Personalization: It uses real-time and past historical information to develop a personalized customer experience for an online banking client. For example, it can use past data to provide shopping recommendations as a client is shopping online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Prescriptive Personalization: Its primary goal is to anticipate a client&#8217;s needs based on existing historical data. Bank marketers can use this information to develop workflows and rules that make it easier to manage their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ways-on-how-baas-providers-can-offer-personalized-banking\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ways-on-how-baas-providers-can-offer-personalized-banking\"><\/span>Ways on How Baas Providers Can Offer Personalized Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a personalized customer experience in the digital payments industry will become more critical as consumer needs evolve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When customers interact with a baas platform, they will expect an experience that takes their past activities into account. They will expect solutions to their problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization combined with <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/banking-as-a-service-baas-explained\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"470\">banking technology<\/a> will make this possible. Banks will be better placed to improve their client&#8217;s journey using custom-tailored recommendations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are examples of how banks can offer personalized experiences:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"segment-their-online-banking-clients-based-on-the-buying-circles\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"segment-their-online-banking-clients-based-on-the-buying-circles\"><\/span>Segment Their Online Banking Clients Based on the Buying Circles<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As with everything else in life, timing is everything. Baas marketers should avoid marketing products based on sales quotas or prevailing trends in the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they should try to turn the data they have in their <strong>CRM into a framework<\/strong> that allows them to run timely and more imaginative promotions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, they can determine the products their clients are more likely to buy at each buying circle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can get this information by looking at the customer-level information using an analytics platform. From here, they should segment the clients based on their buying circles, e.g.,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Awareness<br>\u2022 Consideration<br>\u2022 Decision<br>\u2022 Assessment of choice made<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, banking as a service provider needs to note that first-time visitors differ from visitors who are researching existing products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"develop-personalized-blog-content\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"develop-personalized-blog-content\"><\/span>Develop Personalized Blog Content<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Information-driven content creation has become a central part of developing marketing strategies. The digital payment sector is no exception.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as most marketers know, content can never be a one size fits all situation. There&#8217;s a need to optimize your content based on your client preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Segment them into small clusters and develop content that appeals to each group. Financial institutions can use the following methods to segment clients during the content creation process:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Dividing based on interest<br>\u2022 Dividing based on use<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using these two methods to target your blog content can strengthen your relationships with baas clients. When sending email updates, this type of segmentation will ensure that clients only receive the information they want.<br>It assists in making the updates personalized and demonstrates that banking as a service provider cares about their customer interests.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Consumers have demonstrated an increasing desire to make digital payments from their smartphones, leading to the growth of personalized banking.
