The following is a look at some known examples of artificial intelligence in banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Financial-Data-Collection-and-Analysis.jpg\" alt=\"artificial intelligence\" class=\"wp-image-431\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Financial-Data-Collection-and-Analysis.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Financial-Data-Collection-and-Analysis-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Financial-Data-Collection-and-Analysis-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"mobile-banking-helping-to-generate-more-revenue\"><\/span>Mobile Banking Helping to Generate More Revenue<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence in mobile banking and payment processing has become more advanced, personalized, and proactive. Thanks to artificial intelligence, banks can generate up to 66 per cent more revenue from online banking platforms than traditional bank visits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firms in the digital payments industry have started to pay more attention to emerging technology, hoping that it can assist them in remaining competitive. Some believe that it can also help them improve the quality of their services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"better-data-security-leading-to-reduced-cases-of-credit-card-theft\"><\/span>Better Data Security Leading to Reduced Cases of Credit Card Theft<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a report published by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2021\/02\/new-data-shows-ftc-received-2-2-million-fraud-reports-consumers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Trade Commission<\/a>, credit card fraud is the most rampant form of personal data theft. AI-based digital payment systems are effective in keeping wrongdoers at bay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corporate cloud banking companies deploy them to analyze their customers&#8217; financial habits, location, and general purchasing behaviour. The AI systems automatically trigger a security mechanism in the digital payment system when they detect any unusual behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"transaction-data-enrichment-used-to-decipher-complex-character-strings\"><\/span>Transaction Data Enrichment Used to Decipher Complex Character Strings<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It plays a crucial role in financial management for consumers and companies offering digital payments services. Transaction data enrichment relies on AI and machine learning to decipher unintelligible character strings used to represent merchants and financial transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It assists in converting them into readable text that displays the merchant&#8217;s name and their corresponding address. Transaction data enrichment displays the local business address in use by a merchant instead of the address in use by the corporate office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire process helps convert hard-to-read data into easily understandable data, which assists customers using a digital payment system to know where they spent their money. In the long term, it can help in reducing fraud research costs and customer service calls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transaction data enrichment is an excellent example of how artificial intelligence is changing the banking sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"risk-management-when-determining-creditworthiness\"><\/span>Risk Management When Determining Creditworthiness<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks and other businesses in the payments industry find the process of extending credit to a customer challenging and full of risks. Those who lend money to insolvent customers often find themselves dealing with all kinds of financial difficulties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a borrower who loses access to a stable income is more likely to default on a loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deploying artificial intelligence in the banking sector can assist in appraising customer credit histories more accurately. Banks can use this information to anticipate the risks that may come with issuing a loan to a given client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"financial-data-collection-and-analysis\"><\/span>Financial Data Collection and Analysis<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Firms in the <strong>digital payments<\/strong> sphere record tens of millions of business financial transactions each day. The amount of information generated by these businesses is vast, turning into a collection nightmare for the employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to structure and record this data unless the company has a viable plan for using it. Therefore, it becomes challenging to determine the relationship between the collected data and the client, especially in companies with thousands of clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence applications in use today assist in collecting and analyzing all this data. They help to substantially improve user experience, as banks can use this information to detect fraud and grant loans to eligible clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Mobile-Banking-Helping-to-Generate-More-Revenue.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1064\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Mobile-Banking-Helping-to-Generate-More-Revenue.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Mobile-Banking-Helping-to-Generate-More-Revenue-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Mobile-Banking-Helping-to-Generate-More-Revenue-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-banking-2022\"><\/span>Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in Banking 2022<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing artificial intelligence in the banking sector can bring about the following <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itbusinessedge.com\/development\/top-5-benefits-of-ai-in-banking-and-finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">benefits<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-reduced-costs-for-running-on-site-data-centers\"><\/span>1. Reduced Costs for Running On-site Data Centers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant advantage of adopting corporate cloud banking is that it assists in doing away with the expenses associated with running on-site data centres, e.g., hardware and software apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upfront costs linked to setting up such centres can prove prohibitive when dealing with AI projects. Cloud enterprises eliminate these costs by providing you with access in exchange for a monthly fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com\/tip\/Explore-the-pros-and-cons-of-cloud-computing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">adoption of cloud computing<\/a> in digital payments businesses makes research and development-related expenses more manageable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-better-customer-experience-due-to-round-the-clock-availability-of-banking-facilities\"><\/span>2.

Additionally, call centres were notorious for having long wait times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of artificial intelligence in banking is helping to change all this! Examples include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The use of chatbots on call. Chatbots can provide answers to some of the frequently asked questions removing the need to interact with a human customer service agent.<\/li><li>Banks can use chatbots to upsell their services.
