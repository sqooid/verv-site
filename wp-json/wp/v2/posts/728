money from one bank account to another. This procedure takes place over a computerized network. It does not involve any form of paperwork and takes place independently without the involvement of bank employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronic Funds Transfer is becoming more popular in the transfer of funds and payment procedures. Since the time businesses adopted digital payments, paper checks have become obsolete due to delays and expensive transaction costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sending and receiving accounts do not need to be on the same bank for the transaction to occur. Both parties can use different devices such as computers, card processors, or phones to initiate the transfer process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-is-the-difference-between-eft-and-ach\"><\/span>What is the difference between EFT and ACH?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people cannot differentiate between the two. ACH is an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/what-are-ach-payments-and-how-they-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Automated Clearing House<\/a> and consists of an interconnection of financial institutions whose primary purpose is to offer security in money transfer. In ACH, the transaction request will stop between the initiation and the bank for verification purposes. It may take one or two days, depending on the speed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EFT is a general term for all digital transactions. Therefore, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/what-are-ach-payments-and-how-they-work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACH<\/a> is a form of electronic fund transfer. However, it is essential to note that not all EFTs are ACH transactions. Businesses and consumers have the right to decide on which EFT is suitable for their needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-does-electronic-funds-transfer-work\"><\/span>How Does Electronic Funds Transfer Work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are unaware of how the EFT process takes place. However, before adopting any digital transfer method, it is crucial to understand how it works. The information will let you know how to utilize the preferred payment system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EFT transactions take place using a computer or phone with an internet connection. It does not involve cash since the process involves the transfer of data. The procedure is straightforward. The sender initiates the request through a series of digital networks through the internet or a payment terminal to the receiver\u2019s bank account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sender can be anyone from a buyer, employer, or individual paying for a service. In most cases, recipients are employees, suppliers, service providers, or retailers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-are-different-EFT.jpg\" alt=\"what is an EFT?\" class=\"wp-image-793\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-are-different-EFT.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-are-different-EFT-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/What-are-different-EFT-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-are-the-different-types-of-eft-payments\"><\/span>What are the Different Types of EFT-Payments?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several Electronic Funds Transfer payment channels exist today. Each of these methods provides an easy and fast delivery, making each popular. The most common Electronic Funds Transfer methods include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"debit-and-credit-card-transactions\"><\/span>Debit and Credit card Transactions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Card transaction is a common form of payment available in almost all countries. Individuals can use their cards to perform any transaction. The transactions can take place online or in-person where the cardholder swipes, dip or insert the card into a digital card processor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this action, the information is transferred electronically, which follows the approval of the payment withdrawal. The payment process might take one or two days to reflect on the receiver\u2019s bank account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"direct-bank-deposits\"><\/span>Direct Bank Deposits<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This kind of payment involves depositing cash directly into the receiver\u2019s bank account without any paperwork. Employers mainly use this method when paying salaries to their employees. However, one needs to have the recipient\u2019s bank account details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"phone-money-transfer\"><\/span>Phone Money Transfer<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emizentech.com\/blog\/mobile-payment-statistics-facts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Phone payments<\/a> are the most popular type of money transfer used by millions of people worldwide. The increased use of smartphones contributes to the growth in mobile phone payments. These payments provide a quick and easy way to make payments anywhere and any time since people carry their phones everywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This form of payment utilizes an individual&#8217;s line. The receiver gives details such as the mobile number, and the funds are deposited directly from the sender\u2019s line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"electronic-checks\"><\/span>Electronic Checks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The payer generates a digital check with electronic checks by authorizing the payment. This action can be done through the phone or online. After authorization of the payment, the business can set up to receive the payment. The details are entered into the payment processing system. Once completed, the request goes through a confirmation process, and funds are transferred to the seller from the buyer&#8217;s account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-eft-payment-processing-period\"><\/span>The EFT-Payment Processing Period<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several factors determine the time it will take for an electronic funds transfer. Some of the main factors include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The kind of payment<\/li><li>The service provider<\/li><li>The payment submission time<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While some methods may take minutes to complete the transactions, some will take an average of one to four days.

However, some channels such as card and phone payments will work any time of the week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"-what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-electronic-fund-transfers\"><\/span>&nbsp;What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Electronic Fund Transfers?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"advantages-of-eft\"><\/span>Advantages of EFT<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Provides Fast Access to Money<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast access to money is one of the main advantages of electronic funds transfer. Business people prefer using the Electronic Funds Transfer process as it gives them the freedom to access their money at any time without the need to visit the bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps save time and reduces transaction costs. On the other hand, customers prefer making payments using this process since it is fast and secure.

Despite a few cases of fraudsters and hacking, most online payment systems have put in place strong measures to curb these vices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore electronic fund transfer is one of the safest payment methods to use. Companies such as Verv offer their clients with secure <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift.\">payment gateway<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It does not require the use of credit or debit cards<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several online businesses receive payments through electronic checks.
