Collect Data Across All Online Banking Touchpoints<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start collecting data to help you implement an improved customer experience, begin by establishing how your clientele feels at the moment. You need to collect data across all your <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift.\">digital payments touchpoints<\/a> to determine whether they\u2019re getting a consistent experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is to confirm whether their experience across all touchpoints remains the same or whether it differs. Collecting data across all touchpoints allows you to identify any glaring holes and patch them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Website: Run a short customer satisfaction survey on the official website. Ideally, this should happen immediately after a client has completed a specific action. You could also choose to send a longer survey via email at a later date. Seek to learn:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>o Was the client satisfied with the services offered?<br>o How do they feel about its look and responsiveness?<br>o Were they able to use it across multiple devices?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Customer Service Feedback: Gather feedback immediately after a client has finished talking to a customer service rep. It makes it easier to spot the existing friction points. You\u2019ll learn whether customers have to wait long to get routed to a support agent through it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-provide-multiple-communication-channels\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-provide-multiple-communication-channels\"><\/span>2. Provide Multiple Communication Channels<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your online banking customers don\u2019t have any other communication channel than calling you, it means you need to make changes today. Having calling as the only option is by far too restrictive, especially for those handling and facilitating digital payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that not all clients are comfortable calling or have enough time in their hands to do so. The best way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesbusinesscouncil\/2021\/02\/26\/five-banking-customer-experience-tips-to-improve-digital-transformation\/?sh=90820f762765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve digital transformation<\/a> and enhance customer service is to provide them with multiple support channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, consider introducing chatbots to deal with simple questions that routinely jam up your call centre. The more people who have to call the support desk, the longer new callers have to wait, significantly lowering the customer service experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-banks-using-internet-need-to-locate-existing-friction-points\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-banks-using-internet-need-to-locate-existing-friction-points\"><\/span>3.

Concentrate on establishing whether the clients routinely encounter problems in their online banking journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions to ask yourself and your team will include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 For a customer to open an account with your bank, how many steps will they need to complete?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Are there customers who give up midway before completing the account setup process?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 What\u2019s the specific point where most consumers choose to give up instead of completing their journey?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While friction points aren\u2019t always great, there are instances where they\u2019re unavoidable, e.g., where a bank has to perform a credit check for a new client. If those who abort do so at this point, there\u2019s nothing much you can do about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-give-your-online-banking-clients-an-omnichannel-platform\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-give-your-online-banking-clients-an-omnichannel-platform\"><\/span>4.

Additionally, it avoids the trap of getting locked into different contracts, which may come with software licenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Better synergy across multiple departments: Do you remember the need to maintain consistency so as to offer a better customer experience? How can you provide an excellent experience if your company lacks consistency?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Onboarding and training: Incoming and existing staff will only need to master a single system helping reduce human errors. Training them on several systems may also cause confusion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Data collection and analysis: It\u2019s easier to obtain more meaningful results when all company data gets collected and analyzed at a single location. Your people won\u2019t have to worry about missing, duplicated, or erroneous data that may lead to bad results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-267\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-automation-of-banking-systems-and-processes\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-automation-of-banking-systems-and-processes\"><\/span>5. Automation of Banking Systems and Processes<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, a large percentage of banks and credit unions offering digital payments services are using automation in one way or another. The question, therefore, becomes, should your company consider using it more?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of where you stand on automation, the answer here is a definitive YES. Automation has attained considerable leaps in the last few years, many of which can significantly improve the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significant examples include predictive analytics, which assists you in anticipating when some of your clients may require certain services. Chatbots can help with service automation by answering simple and frequently asked questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6-train-your-people-to-act-immediately\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6-train-your-people-to-act-immediately\"><\/span>6.

Whenever a customer complaint comes in, ensure it gets addressed immediately. It\u2019s something that should apply to complaints coming in across all channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, more customers are turning to social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Facebook, to air out their complaints. They prefer these channels because they\u2019re assured of a timely response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No company wants the whole world to see their customer complaints. While this is understandable, this should apply to all channels. You\u2019ll appear insincere if you respond to online banking complaints via social media faster than on other support channels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customer experience has become the new business buzzword.
