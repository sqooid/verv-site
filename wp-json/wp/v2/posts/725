If you\u2019re an ex-pat, you may want to do this when buying a car or a house in your new country of residence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/consumer-tools\/sending-money\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau<\/a>, you should know a few things before using banking as a service platform to remit money. These will include your rights, the information the platform should provide, and how to compare costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from your rights, there\u2019s a need to learn about the different platforms available and how each operates. Most importantly, you should know that remitting funds internationally depends on whether you want to value, security, speed, or a blend of all three.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_45 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-grey ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title\">Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle\" area-label=\"ez-toc-toggle-icon-1\"><label for=\"item-673d660a4a473\" aria-label=\"Table of Content\"><span style=\"display: flex;align-items: center;width: 35px;height: 30px;justify-content: center;direction:ltr;\"><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" class=\"list-377408\" width=\"20px\" height=\"20px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"><path d=\"M6 6H4v2h2V6zm14 0H8v2h12V6zM4 11h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2zM4 16h2v2H4v-2zm16 0H8v2h12v-2z\" fill=\"currentColor\"><\/path><\/svg><svg style=\"fill: #999;color:#999\" class=\"arrow-unsorted-368013\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"10px\" height=\"10px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" version=\"1.2\" baseProfile=\"tiny\"><path d=\"M18.2 9.3l-6.2-6.3-6.2 6.3c-.2.2-.3.4-.3.7s.1.5.3.7c.2.2.4.3.7.3h11c.3 0 .5-.1.7-.3.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7zM5.8 14.7l6.2 6.3 6.2-6.3c.2-.2.3-.5.3-.7s-.1-.5-.3-.7c-.2-.2-.4-.3-.7-.3h-11c-.3 0-.5.1-.7.3-.2.2-.3.5-.3.7s.1.5.3.7z\"\/><\/svg><\/span><\/label><input  type=\"checkbox\" id=\"item-673d660a4a473\"><\/a><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/send-money-abroad-what-you-need-to-know\/#send-money-abroad-6-things-you-need-to-know-before-you-do\" title=\"Send Money Abroad: 6 Things You Need to Know Before You Do \">Send Money Abroad: 6 Things You Need to Know Before You Do <\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3'><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/send-money-abroad-what-you-need-to-know\/#1-the-laws-in-the-country-of-residence\" title=\"1.

The Laws in The Country of Residence<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending funds abroad isn\u2019t a crime, but it may become one if you aren\u2019t careful. Organized crime syndicates have used <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/the-simple-guide-on-electronic-funds-transfers\/#:~:text=economy%20relies%20on-,digital%20payments,-.%20This%20means%20that\">digital payments<\/a> for money laundering purposes for years. The situation has forced local law enforcement to formulate laws to prevent such crimes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fraud, racketeering, and tax evasion are serious crimes that attract severe penalties. Failure to observe laws governing international money transfers can lead to your arrest. You can protect yourself from this by keeping abreast of all money transfer laws in your country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, learn whether your country of residence has placed a cap on the amounts permissible for transmission without tax forms. Others may require you to file a report even when performing a one-time transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-available-money-transfer-options\"><\/span>2. Available Money Transfer Options<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks were once the only option available to individuals looking to send money. Today, this is no longer the case, thanks to the emergence of cheaper and <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/send-money-abroad-the-best-options-out-there\/#:~:text=Cheaper%20and%20flexible%20options\">more flexible options<\/a>. Below is a look at some of these options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Verv: Individuals with Verv personal accounts can send money abroad to over 120 countries. It has some of the most competitive rates in the money transfers market while protecting your account with password-less biometric authentication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 PayPal: The giant money transfer company easily beats its peers with its fast services. All you need to send funds is an account on the platform. The recipient will receive the funds instantly and transfer them to their bank account the next day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Wise: Formerly known as TransferWise, Wise has the best exchange rates in the industry. Its upfront fees are low and allow you to remit funds to over 70 countries. Same-day delivery services are available, while bank transfers may take a few days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-exchange-rates\"><\/span>3. Exchange Rates<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before using <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/baas-explained-comparison-of-baas-service-providers\/#:~:text=processing%20industry%20is-,banking%20as%20a%20service,-(BaaS)%20and%20the\">banking as a service<\/a> platform to remit money, make sure you know the prevailing exchange rates. Every money transfer platform will provide a different exchange rate, making it necessary to compare what each offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not uncommon to come across meagre exchange rates on some platforms. Platforms may offer low rates to enable them to profit from the transaction. Take your time to compare the rates on offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure of what to do, visit their official websites and compare the rates listed with those on Google. Other comparison sites include XE and other platforms offering the same remittance service. Remember, the higher the rate, the money a recipient will receive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-research.jpg\" alt=\"research how to send money abroad\" class=\"wp-image-789\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-research.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-research-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-research-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-service-charges-on-offer\"><\/span>4. Service Charges on Offer<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most money remittance companies claim to have the lowest fees in the market to attract more users. Banks apply the same approach when marketing their remittance services. However, you shouldn\u2019t let these marketing gimmicks fool you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital payment companies, banks, and <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">payment gateways<\/a> aren\u2019t required by law to reveal what happens behind the scenes during the transfer process. The trick lies in knowing what questions to ask before you transact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Determining the exchange rate the platform will use on your transaction can allow you to learn a few truths. For example, you should walk away from a platform that offers a low rate but doesn\u2019t charge any service fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why You Need to Walk Away<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You stand a better chance with a company that charges a fixed service charge per transaction. Such banking as a service platform will offer an exchange rate that\u2019s either high for each dollar or reasonably close to the mid-market rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at it, establish whether the amount you get after multiplying the amount sent with the exchange rate matches what the recipient will receive. If you learn that the platform will subtract a separate fee on the receiving end, this can reduce the amount received.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts refer to this technique as \u2018adding an under-serviced charge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-reputation-and-security-of-the-banking-as-a-service-platform\"><\/span>5. Reputation and Security of the Banking as a Service Platform<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Security is always an issue when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/investing\/what-are-etfs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dealing with EFTs<\/a>. While banks are traditionally secure, they aren\u2019t the first choice for sending money abroad. It would help if you looked into the security of every platform under consideration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, focus on the website security of currency specialists and money transfer platforms before signing up. Check whether they have data protection measures, e.g., encryption standards, to protect the data from getting intercepted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inquire from family and friends on which options are the best. While at it, confirm that your bank details won\u2019t get revealed or sold to third parties. Check the address bar to confirm that it starts with HTTPS or has a green lock button before the URL.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6-the-transfer-speed\"><\/span>6. The Transfer Speed<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you want to send money to another country doesn\u2019t mean it should take long to reach the recipient. Apart from security and the exchange rate, the speed at which the recipient will receive the money also matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A speedy transfer is necessary as an emergency might occur at any moment. Confirm with the service provider the number of hours or days it will take for the recipient to receive the money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that some platforms provide a higher rate for speedy transfers. Others may charge higher transaction costs for the same service. Choose a platform that won\u2019t take too long to deliver the funds where they\u2019re needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"risks-when-sending-money-abroad\"><\/span>Risks When Sending Money Abroad<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know what you need to know before sending money abroad, it\u2019s time to look at the potential risks of such a transaction. The options listed earlier are safe and secure, but international transactions aren\u2019t without risks. Such risks can include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Exchange Rates: Most money remittance platforms will lock in a rate once they have sent you a quote. If possible, try to remit the funds using the recipient\u2019s currency. Where this is impossible, take your time to understand all the applicable fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Delays: Delays are common even when dealing with established and reputable companies. Although they can occur for several reasons, the company should have a compensation policy in place in case of delays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Applicable Limits: Research the transaction limits put in place by each platform. Some are best for large transfers, while others will charge you favourably for smaller transactions. Research in advance to avoid getting disappointed at the last minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"details-needed-to-send-money-abroad\"><\/span>Details Needed to Send Money Abroad<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the method or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/sending-money-to-family-and-friends-fast\/#:~:text=You%20only%20need%20the%20receiver&#039;s,to%20check%20before%20sending%20money.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">platform<\/a>, you want to use to send money, you\u2019ll need to have specific details with you.
