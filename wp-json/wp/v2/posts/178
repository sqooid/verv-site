This begs the question: what is the future of digital payments in the payment industry, and what is there to expect from online financial services?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many individuals globally are becoming tech-savvy, which means they become more open to endless opportunities, which was mostly accelerated by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because the smartphone penetration had surpassed 3.2 billion consumers in 2020, and the numbers are rapidly rising.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such tremendous upsurge in numbers, especially because of COVID-19, has certainly resulted in a shift in the customer payment preferences and financial transaction volumes online. Whichever way you think about it, you have to contend that the future of digital payments looks brighter than ever. They are only bound to grow more popular for key reasons we outline below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments1.jpg\" alt=\"future of digital payments\" class=\"wp-image-277\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-future-of-digital-payments-in-the-payments-industry-the-trends-to-expect\"><\/span>The future of digital payments in the payments industry: The trends to expect<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The level of innovation in the payments industry is key to the future of digital payments. This is because innovation is greatly driven by the dynamic nature of the payment processors. That is why is the world is heading into 2022; there is expected to be accelerated growth in the B2B digital payment system, which points towards a sort of transformation change in the online payment industry. In that regard, here are some of the trends you expect as 2022 prepares to come in:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Rising demand for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/blogposting\/19402\/what-is-the-future-of-digital-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">frictionless payments solution:<\/a> A frictionless payments solution is essentially enjoying online payments without any barriers, especially at checkout. It depends on who uses digital payment services because a frictionless system eliminates the waiting time and steps to follow to complete a transaction. Because of the internet\u2019s ubiquity and access to smart devices, businesses should gear up for an upsurge in digital payments in 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 The increased number of mobile payments, loyalty apps and eWallets: What are digital payment methods you can think about when you think of 2022? eWallets, mobile payments and loyalty apps are the way to go, and they are expected to skyrocket in the next year. These methods reduce intermediaries and always offer proof of digital payment. It is expected that more businesses will embrace these payment methods by integrating different payment processing providers to enable mobile payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Global adoption of real-time digital payments: Digital payments predictions forecast that many global merchants will adopt real-time payments (RTP). These systems are efficient and allow financial transaction volumes in real-time. The proliferation of P2P apps, digital currencies, smartphones and real-time settlement systems have caused tremendous changes to take shape. The growing need to satisfy customers&#8217; changing needs is the driving factor behind the adoption of RTPs. If not, customers will shift to newer and more aggressive payment providers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Increased numbers of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/2022-altering-future-payments-apurvaa-gaikwad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cross-border transactions<\/a>: In recent years, not so many people have understood the advantages of digital payment systems. Therefore, the cross-border transaction volumes were lower, slower and more expensive. This is mostly because of government regulations and barriers to entry. The advent of digital payments have eliminated most of these barriers and have made merchants seek alternative payment methods to streamline the global payment systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Battle of the rails: With the shift from traditional hard currencies to online payments, there is bound to be many market entrants in the digital payment ecosystem, creating serious competition. Therefore, the existing rails like cards and eWallets have to reposition themselves in the payments industry to stay relevant. Such competition will be instrumental in 2022 because new services will come into existence to attract new customers and retain the old ones. The result will be better services for the customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments2.jpg\" alt=\"future of digital payments\" class=\"wp-image-278\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-about-the-issue-of-financial-crimes\"><\/span>What about the issue of financial crimes?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Will<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/gx\/en\/industries\/financial-services\/publications\/financial-services-in-2025\/payments-in-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> financial crime <\/a>affect the future of digital payments? A valid question to ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as there are incredible benefits of digital payments, the growing market also opens up an entirely new loophole, fraudsters. Since 2020, the average number of attempted fraudulent online purchases has increased by about 70% compared to 2019. This is according to a report by Sift, a digital fraud prevention company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining a new set of online payment players and open banking opens up new opportunities for different kinds of financial crimes like exposing consumers to scams. On the other hand, payment rails helping <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/business-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">merchants move funds across borders<\/a> could lead to money laundering and enable sanctions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to various reports, some of the top concerns are compliance, security, and data privacy risks. This calls for the urgent need for FinTechs to take charge and implement fully integrated technological strategies to combat such incidents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, there will be a great need for collaboration among the public, banking sector and the different payment rails to develop strategies to prevent money laundering and fraud. At the same time, there should be expected trade-offs between consumer convenience and cyber security measures. This is according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bis.org\/fsi\/fsibriefs7.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report<\/a> by Bank for International Settlement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments3.jpg\" alt=\"future of digital payments\" class=\"wp-image-279\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_payments3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital payments journey as the world moves towards 2022 is exciting.
