Here are some of the most important ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>The high-yield savings accounts<\/strong>.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Since most online business banking does not have the overhead costs and infrastructure of conventional banks, it becomes increasingly possible for such online saving accounts to offer higher yields on cash savings compared to the conventional banks. For instance, some of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/best-online-savings-accounts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best online saving accounts<\/a> as of December 2020 were offering annual percentage yields (APY) rates around 0.40% and 0.81% APY.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it is only a good idea for you to shop around first. This is because not every online bank will accord you the same features you need for your business. For instance, you may have to forego debit cards for some of the highest-yielding accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it would be vital for you to understand the requirements and rules for your online banking account to accept digital payments for you to qualify for the best APY rate. You may have to part with higher minimum deposits for higher yielding ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Multiple banking products on offer<\/strong>.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Different business come with different financial goals. Therefore, this is where all the differences come in and differentiating the kind of online account a business wishes to open. It could be because of earning higher rates on the saving accounts or just choose to use one aspect of online banking and continue enjoying using conventional banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whichever the preference is, that\u2019s fine. However, many online banks today offer multiple business banking products and services. More banks are expanding to offering more than just savings accounts. Some even offer checking accounts, credit\/debit cards, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and even loans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>The minimum balance allowable<\/strong>.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Many online banks have a minimum balance requirement that a business has to maintain. The amount will vary depending on the preferred online bank for digital payments. Some of the best ones just have a 0 minimum balance requirement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may seem like a small thing to consider but it\u2019s something that you should keep your eye on, especially of you use your savings account for emergencies or you have a savings goal. This is because you could easily run an empty account for some time without worrying about penalties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>The investment help offered<\/strong>.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the core reasons why the digital payments space has experienced massive growth is the aspect of online investment management, otherwise referred to as robo-advisers. This is a form of AI technology that some of the biggest online business banking platforms utilize to help manage their clients\u2019 investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, they are instrumental in helping businesses to invest in a balanced portfolio of bonds and stocks to be in tandem with their risk tolerance and financial goal. These robo-advisers aid in saving for retirement and at the same time help business accumulate better returns on some of their short-term savings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, any business should be careful enough to understand the fine print while clarifying their business investment goals and at the same time keeping in mind the time horizon and risk tolerance before choosing to sign up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the years go by, FinTech startups and online banks are becoming central in the life of many businesses. Therefore, despite the online bank you choose for your business needs, it is always important to read the fine print and comprehend the limits, risks, and possible fees for you to make an informed decision that will be in tandem with your financial goals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction Many business are now taking advantage of the digital payments space and the growth of the digital business banking industry to move their businesses online.
