Mobile and online budgeting tools<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, you could only find digital budgeting tools via third-party programs, apps and software. Therefore, you had to do your budgeting separately from your bank account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since online banking is rapidly growing, more banking systems are now incorporating these budgeting tools to help their customers stay on top of their expenditure without the need of logging out of their banking apps or portal to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, keep in mind that these apps aren\u2019t the same across the board. They will vary depending on the bank you\u2019re using. Bottom line is, all these apps will help you plan ahead while tracking your expenses. You essentially cut down the process of budgeting, making things easier compared to using traditional banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-automatic-savings-deposits\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-automatic-savings-deposits\"><\/span>2.

It could be daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly. Furthermore, the best way to do this is to schedule these transfers to fall on the same day funds hit your account. This will help in reducing the chances of overdrawing your account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you feel you are ready to start automating your savings, head over to the Transfers section on your bank, choose the amount you wish to periodically transfer and the accounts to receive the funds and let online banking do the rest for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-mobile-check-deposits\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-mobile-check-deposits\"><\/span>3. Mobile check deposits<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of paper checks is less prevalent today but they still exist. As of 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/paymentsystems\/2019-December-The-Federal-Reserve-Payments-Study.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the Federal Reserve<\/a>, about 8.3% of payments were checks, but the number has dropped from 58.8% in 2000.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the growing need for online banking, people don\u2019t need to keep running to the bank to deposit their checks. Therefore, it is easy to save more since it won\u2019t cost you money running around to the bank or risk losing your check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banking online allows you to perform mobile check deposits, making digital check processing way easier without the need to visit the local ATM or bank branch.

In the past, paper bills would act as reminders when you find them sitting around on the kitchen table. Since most bills are paid online nowadays, it is easy to forget to make these digital payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, if you find yourself forgetting about these digital payments, it may be time to consider setting up automatic bill pay with your online bank to help you pay your bills on time. This will go a long way in improving your credit while cutting down on the late fees, letting you save more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-low-balance-alerts\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-low-balance-alerts\"><\/span>5.
