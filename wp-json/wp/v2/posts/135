From this, they can learn how to protect themselves from payment method hijacking by looking at the measures implemented by others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common types of digital payments fraud include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Identity Theft Used to Commit Illegal Transactions<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The total value of digital payments transactions stood at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/study\/41122\/fintech-report-digital-payments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$5.2 trillion <\/a>at the end of 2020. Experts in the payments industry believe identity theft is the most common strategy deployed by fraudsters looking to commit payment fraud.<br>Although the scam was present even before the advent of the internet, the tricks used by the scammers to complete a financial transaction keep changing each year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, identity thieves steal client information from online shops by using phishing techniques to capture vital payment information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Credit Card Fraud<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the most common type of payment fraud in digital payments and is the one most people have heard about or encountered. The fraud involves completing a financial transaction using stolen payment data, e.g., another person\u2019s banking information or credit card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those in the payments industry state that this type of fraud happens from a hack of an improperly secured customer information database. The information obtained from the hack gets sold in online black-market places where it\u2019s used to make illegal transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Payment Fraud Committed Through Payment Information Interception.<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry insiders refer to it as the \u201cman in the middle fraud.\u201d It\u2019s a type of payment fraud where hackers and cybercriminals take over the operations of a digital payment system. All the fraudsters need to do is intercept the transactions before they are completed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some scammers execute this type of fraud by impersonating company reps before redirecting incoming leads to fake eCommerce platforms. For example, one can respond to customer comments on a business website and leave behind bad\/redirected links.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_fraud1.jpg\" alt=\"payment fraud\" class=\"wp-image-235\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_fraud1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_fraud1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_fraud1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Protect Your Business from Payment Fraud<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it\u2019s not always possible for consumers and eCommerce merchants to protect themselves from digital payments fraud, it\u2019s possible to limit their exposure. There are steps one can take to safeguard their personal information and payment processing system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Employ 3- or 4-Way Matching Payments Solution<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Merchants that can match every invoice to a receipt of goods ordered or purchase order can protect their company from fraud. Most online fraudsters don\u2019t have the time or energy needed to fabricate three or four different documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses can use robotic processing to create templates that zone in on specific fields and classify certain invoices using high-volume generators. An alternative is to employ cognitive generators to compare incoming requests against those flagged in the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also pays to have a dedicated in-house team that can manually review each payment request to protect against online payment fraud. If appropriately used,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rfsuny.org\/media\/rfsuny\/procedures\/ap_2-3-4-way-matching_pro.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> 3-or 4-way matching<\/a> can guarantee up to 100% protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>Safe Browsing to Prevent Credit Card Fraud<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern technology has, without a doubt made banking and online payment much easier and convenient. But, it has also created loopholes, which, if left unsecured, can easily expose you to bad guys interested in grabbing your cash.<br>Refrain from making financial transactions when using unprotected Wi-Fi networks. You should also avoid checking your account balances or making money transfers using online payment processors when connected to public Wi-Fi networks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, ensure that your computer has the latest virus and malware protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Use Mobile Payments When Making Payments to Financial Services Providers<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up mobile payments from your smartphone to use at retailers that accept online payment like Google Pay or Apple Pay can protect you from credit card fraud. The setup ensures you won\u2019t have to swipe your card anywhere.<br>Remember, fraudsters can use skimmers to get your banking information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, it guarantees that you won\u2019t expose your security codes or card numbers when swiping at the point of sale system. The mobile payment accounts are typically linked to a credit or debit card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Protect Your Mail from Financial Services Fraudsters<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S Postal Service recently introduced a service known as<a href=\"https:\/\/informeddelivery.usps.com\/box\/pages\/intro\/start.action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Informed Delivery.<\/a> The agency uses this free service to send you photos of letter-sized postal mail undergoing delivery via email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It allows you to know of all the mail arriving soon.

These solutions vary in terms of how much you need to get involved during the installation and setup process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the developer, some will call for a hands-on approach, while others will do most of the work for you. These solutions mainly fall under three categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Rudimentary Anti-Fraud Tools: Normally integrated into eCommerce platforms and shopping carts. They identify illegal transactions using machine learning algorithms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Mid-Level Anti-Fraud Tools: They provide numerous functions such as account takeover protection, chargeback guarantees, and protection against new account fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Top-Level Anti-Fraud Tools: These tools are more advanced and include everything mentioned above and other services such as policy abuse protection.#<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Always Use a Regulated Payment Solutions Provider<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All serious payment providers are governed by some form of regulation and fall under the auspices of a recognised regulatory body. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Verv is no different.<\/a> Belonging to a regulated body helps companies maintain high levels of internal and external payment security layers that both restrict and mitigate possible payment fraud situations. Therefore every time you will choose to open an account with one of these providers, make sure that they are regulated, if unsure you may always look them up under the regulators website and conduct your due diligence before opening an account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge is power when it comes to protecting yourself against the different types of fraud present in the payments industry.
