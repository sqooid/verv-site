However, inasmuch as the banking sector is experiencing a much-needed revolution, this is far from over.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic that recently hit the world has been the unforeseen catalyst towards the adoption of Financial Technology, especially in digital payments. Today, online shopping, mobile payment, and a host of other activities aren\u2019t just a matter of convenience but rather a necessity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many banks are moving to integrate digital payment processors to ensure that all their customers enjoy this revolution. Therefore, it is only evident that banks need Financial technology companies, and this post sheds more light on this. Read on to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2.jpg\" alt=\"Financial Technology\" class=\"wp-image-248\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-element-of-innovation-opportunity-and-resilience-how-do-fintech-companies-work\"><\/span>The element of innovation, opportunity and resilience: How do FinTech companies work?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many banks need FinTechs in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skeps.com\/blog\/the-importance-of-fintech-in-the-post-covid-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">navigating a post-COVID<\/a> business world because these companies tend to demonstrate some element of resilience. Therefore, these companies can break down any financial challenge while offering hope of cruising through the COVID-19 crisis intact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that FinTechs remain agile and willing to embrace remote working while having a high level of equity finance is the reason why these companies continue to withstand the disruption caused by the pandemic. They have embraced some crucial steps that have enabled us to reduce risk exposure and the need to cut costs or reduce their workforce, unlike with the conventional banking industry..<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a report by Beauhurst, only 1% of the current FinTech companies experienced critical disruption due to the pandemic. When you compare high-growth companies to these FinTechs, you immediately realise that about 17% were severely affected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, many FinTechs portrayed an increasing demand because the customer banking habits and working practices changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As days go by, the contactless payments in the online payment industry continue to change the face of the game. For instance, the onset of contactless payments solutions has created faster, efficient and cheaper banking services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank1.jpg\" alt=\"Financial Technology\" class=\"wp-image-249\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-acceleration-of-banking-digitalisation-by-fintech-companies\"><\/span>The acceleration of banking digitalisation by FinTech companies<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the rapid rise of Financial technology providers in the payments industry, many traditional banks have plenty on their plates to think about, especially on digital payments. Inasmuch as banks market their products and services to their consumers depending on the analytics from personal interactions, FinTech companies, on the other hand, are purely customer-centric when thinking about digital payments. They rely on hard data to enable them to respond to their customers\u2019 needs depending on what companies are FinTech ideals affecting. .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is clear that FinTechs in the payments industry are greatly efficient in how they incorporate<a href=\"https:\/\/www.financierworldwide.com\/role-of-fintech-in-the-post-covid-19-world#.YXpEJhxRXIU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> artificial intelligence (AI), <\/a>including machine learning in the automation of their process to help reduce errors. Furthermore, a report in The Review of Financial Studies discovered that FinTech companies managed to process mortgage applications 20% faster than other financial services institutions with no rise in defaults. Also, there aren\u2019t challenges of fewer staffing needs because their consumers access their services virtually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to appreciate the growth of Financial technology companies valued, especially mobile apps, have made customers come up with higher expectations from their banks because they now want more user-friendly interfaces, personalised services, greater efficiency and convenience. Therefore, banks holding such users\u2019 bank accounts don\u2019t have any choice but try their best to integrate such systems to retain their old customers while attracting new ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-important-are-fintech-companies-in-the-post-covid-world\"><\/span>How important are FinTech companies in the post-COVID world?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many consumers continue to adapt to a digital lifestyle and now expect <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itproportal.com\/features\/what-does-technology-mean-for-the-post-covid-19-banking-sector\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">seamles<\/a>s banking and payment processing, and that\u2019s why Financial technology has the upper hand. There are many reasons why these FinTechs are important, but here are a few important ones:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Enabling the innovation of Blockchain startups: Every FinTech report includes Blockchain in the last few years. Since <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Blockchain is entirely digital,<\/a> FinTechs in the payments industry will help startups increase their digital financial transaction volumes while educating customers on the expected risks and how to stay safe from fraud. This will help them come up with innovations to stay afloat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Improving the profitability of financial institutions: FinTechs help financial institutions improve their operations and profitability. They can help improve such services as account management, security checks, payment processing and risk assessments that may need human involvement while leveraging their technical expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Reaching out and helping those that are unbanked: Governments could enjoy receiving help from Financial technology providers, especially in the provision of banking services to customers that lack access. They will help boost their transparency, speed and security, which will allow for the design of sustainable financial products and services designed especially for the unbanked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank3.jpg\" alt=\"Financial Technology\" class=\"wp-image-250\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/bank3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-aspect-of-digital-inclusion-for-the-unbanked\"><\/span>The aspect of digital inclusion for the unbanked<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world continues to recover from the ravaging effects of the pandemic, the element of financial inclusion for the unbanked by FinTech is an area of particular concern. The World Bank contends that there are almost 1.7 billion unbanked customers in the world, and FinTechs will be instrumental in integrating these individuals in the central bank or global digital payment system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration will be vital in mitigating the social and economic impact of the pandemic. Since they are largely expanding to other areas, they are opening more doors to a cashless society. Furthermore, FinTechs will aid in the delivery of effective, efficient and sustainable banking services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>More Financial technology solutions, especially in digital payments, are continuously staying relevant in the post COVID financial landscape.
