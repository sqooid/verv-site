The shift to different payment processors from the conventional banking systems has also threatened the rate of profitability and has forced the banking sector to start revolutionizing their approaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks are now moving from their physical branches and taking advantage of big data and information technology (IT) to be in tandem with the ever-changing digital payment technologies. Therefore, everything is moving towards customer-centric functionalism and that\u2019s why contactless payments are taking over.

The disruption is mostly as a result of the technological advancements and a shift in the consumer expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been tremendous growth of internet application programming interfaces (APIs) like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Blockchain technology<br>\u2022 Digital currencies<br>\u2022 Cloud computing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The growth of these APIs have helped in allowing for service improvements in the new payments solution. Furthermore, they are faster and offer incredible support to allow for easier unbundling services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, unlike two decades ago, mobile devices have facilitated the growth and expansion of digital financial services because they are increasingly indispensable in many customers\u2019 lives. That is why there is increased coverage of multiple payments including online shopping and money transfers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking2.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Payments\" class=\"wp-image-151\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"global-shift-towards-contactless-payments\"><\/span>Global shift towards contactless payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ecb.europa.eu\/euro\/html\/digitaleuro-report.en.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report <\/a>provided by the European Central Bank, there was an increase in digital payments by 8.1% in 2019 in comparison with 2018 and of these payments 48% were card payments. Therefore, this is a clear indication that the European market has a robust digital payments market and the conventional cash infrastructure is experiencing a steady decline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>China, now considered a global leader in cashless payments solution, is home to mobile wallet consumers, accounting for about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/daf\/competition\/digital-disruption-in-banking-and-its-impact-on-competition-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">70% of the entire population<\/a>. Also, it is expected that the country will be among the first ones to go cashless in future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-about-the-unbanked-countries\"><\/span>How about the unbanked countries?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, there are many countries that still depend on cash transactions, which means there isn\u2019t much to go with in regards to their digital payments journeys.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/blogposting\/19402\/what-is-the-future-of-digital-payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">about 85% of Latin America\u2019s population<\/a> still depends on the cash financial transaction. Furthermore, only 39% of the population own a bank account. The primary reason why these figures are practically low is the lack of trust towards their financial institutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the level of mistrust towards financial institutions, many people are buying mobile devices. This offers a great opportunity for the citizens to adopt app-based digital payment alternatives, which will play vital role in elevating their acceptance of a digital payment system and enjoy the benefits of digital payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a replication of a similar situation in Asian countries, especially in India. In four transactions made in India, three are cash transactions because just about a third of the country\u2019s population enjoys internet access. Also, keep in mind that about 20% of them don\u2019t have bank accounts. However, there has been gradual push towards going digital with their payments, especially after the pandemic. The more there is smartphone penetration, the more the rate of digitalisation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Payments\" class=\"wp-image-152\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/digital_banking3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-future-of-digital-payments-how-is-the-space-looking-like\"><\/span>The future of digital payments: How is the space looking like?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Projections by experts in the digital payments space contend that there is a possibility of seeing:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Voice activated payments<br>\u2022 Biometric payments, which include face recognition<br>\u2022 Digital currencies like Bitcoin<br>\u2022 Social media initiated payments<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these things are about to become mainstream in the near future. However, one thing is for certain- mobile wallets and mobile payments will increasingly enjoy adoption and developing countries will mostly the ones that will gain tremendously from this growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, there will be increased <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business-standard.com\/article\/economy-policy\/digital-payments-rise-at-55-cagr-vy-volume-in-five-years-to-fy20-rbi-data-120101100400_1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">uptake of QR codes and NFC payments<\/a> when looking to make secure online payment when doing online shopping. Inasmuch as the use of QR codes is prevalent in China, many countries have been slow to adopt it.
