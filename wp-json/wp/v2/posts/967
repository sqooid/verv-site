class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence is one of the many banking integrations that has been a big game-changer. It has generally improved the banking sector. That is from hiring and transactions to storing important bank information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many banks worldwide like Verv have implemented it to ensure there is a steady flow of services throughout the day. It has not only been important to the banking industry. Even businesses that rely on banks 24\/7 have greatly benefited from transacting safely and faster. This is because AI has made reliable <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">payment processors and gateways<\/a> possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the application of AI in the banking sector is challenging, it is all worth it because banks can function effortlessly and provide better services than ever. Here are a few things AI has changed in the financial sector;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ai-has-eliminated-fraud-and-cybercrime-activities\"><\/span>AI Has Eliminated Fraud and Cybercrime Activities<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fraud is one thing that troubles many banking industries. This is because they want to ensure all digital payments linked to their bank are safe and offer reliable transactions without customers worrying about cybercrime activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human beings can sometimes make mistakes, especially when it comes to repetitive tasks, but an AI can function optimally throughout the year so long as you constantly update it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"it-improves-customer-experience\"><\/span>It Improves Customer Experience<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is great placement in banking as it also boosts customer experience. Most customers usually find it hard to complete transactions or even borrow loans. Thankfully, AI allows customers to learn how to use digital payments step by step. On the other hand, banks can easily know who to fund and which customers are most likely to default on the loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, AI has led to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ronshevlin\/2021\/12\/31\/the-5-hottest-technologies-in-banking-for-2022\/?sh=666c212677dc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use of chatbots<\/a>, meaning that customers can address their most pressing questions and complete what they want to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, this has reduced the hiring cost for banking industries. Banks can then save that money to use in other business sectors. For example, they can implement more AI tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"ai-makes-it-easier-for-people-to-invest-in-banks\"><\/span>AI Makes It Easier for People to Invest in Banks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing your money is one of the most crucial things and also risky. This is why it is important to understand how a bank functions before putting your money in it. Sometimes banks also invest in other projects, and they still need to know the inner working of a certain project before going for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that AI can automate the investment process and provide you with the necessary readings. For example, if banks want to invest in trading, they can easily automate the investments using AI-powered tools to receive updates now and then.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bank integration API has also been possible with AI tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"augmented-reality-in-banking\"><\/span>Augmented Reality in Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/augmented-reality-and-banking-integrations.jpg\" alt=\"Artificial Intelligence in Banking \" class=\"wp-image-970\" width=\"399\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/augmented-reality-and-banking-integrations.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/augmented-reality-and-banking-integrations-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Traditional banks are becoming a thing of the past due to these wonderful banking integrations introduced in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/unit-raises-18-6m-to-offer-banking-features-as-a-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the banking sector<\/a>. Although the technology is still in its early stages, it has proven to work for most banks as it has enabled customers to interact with banks easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many customers who do not understand how the banking system works can use virtual reality or augmented reality to understand how the process works. This has also eliminated long lines in the banks, allowing customers to be served faster and efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ways augmented reality has improved the banking industry includes;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"self-service-has-become-a-new-thing\"><\/span>Self-Service Has Become a New Thing<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people today prefer doing everything from the comfort of their homes. This is because banking apps are becoming common, and smartphones are no longer a new thing. It has allowed many people to perform several transactions in a day without ever leaving their office or home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Augmented reality, on the other hand, is ensuring customers understand banking information before proceeding with any digital payments. Customers can understand how loans work, their accounts, and mortgages, among many other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"reduce-the-need-for-documentation\"><\/span>Reduce the Need for Documentation<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The development of AR is bringing down the need for endless documentation in the banking industry. This kind of banking integration helps save a lot of time as you do not always have to visit the bank with several documents to borrow a loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks do not also need to store various documents, and this reduces the risk of losing important documents. Cheques can also be issued virtually. This helps to save a lot of time and energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"it-is-easier-locating-atms\"><\/span>It is Easier Locating ATMs<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding an ATM to withdraw money was a real hassle in the past. Today, things have changed, and people can find ATMs conveniently, even outside their homes. All of this has been made possible with augmented reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in India, an AR app is known as \u201cNear Me\u201d allows you to find ATMs near you. It provides you with real-time location, services offered, and the distance it will take to get there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"business-intelligence-in-banking\"><\/span>Business Intelligence in Banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business Intelligence is one of the banking integrations, not most people have heard of, but it works and improves efficiency in the financial sector. The technology helps banks have an idea of the number of customers in their business and helps them know how to boost customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also assists banks to be more functional in specific areas and provide accurate and unbiased information. Other things business intelligence can do are;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"it-offers-strategic-development\"><\/span>It Offers Strategic Development<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With business intelligence, banks can gain more insight into investing their money. It allows them to access more information on what customers are looking for and how they can leverage that to improve returns in the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"offers-increased-risk-management-plan\"><\/span>Offers Increased Risk Management Plan<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the banking industry, there are many risks, which is why banks have integrated business intelligence to allow layering in banking and minimize risks. Such risks may include user data, customer risk, and cyber threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cyber threats are common, but financial services like Verv use multi-decentralized blockchain networks to ensure all transactions are safe.
