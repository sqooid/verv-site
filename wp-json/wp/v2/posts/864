However, the type of corporate account needed will vary from business to business. Below is a look at the five most popular types of corporate accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-business-checking-account-from-verv\"><\/span>1. Business Checking Account from Verv<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/verv.novatti.com\/business-account\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">business checking account<\/a> is by far the most versatile of all known corporate account types. Business owners love this account because it doesn&#8217;t have many restrictions regarding what you can do with the money it holds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The account provides you with several methods to withdraw your funds, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 ATM and debit card transactions<br>\u2022 Electronic transfers<br>\u2022 Checks<br>\u2022 Wire transfers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an account that provides you with a great place to hold your money, making it easier to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesfinancecouncil\/2022\/03\/14\/15-important-startup-expenses-many-new-founders-dont-budget-enough-for\/?sh=1313c529565d#:~:text=for%20%E2%80%9Cmore%20important%E2%80%9D-,expenses,-.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cover your business expenses<\/a>. The account offers numerous ways of adding money to it, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 ATM deposits were allowed<br>\u2022 Electronic transfers<br>\u2022 Branch deposits<br>\u2022 Wire transfer<br>\u2022 Mobile check deposit<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most business accounts also integrate with other corporate tools, such as accounting software. Although this isn&#8217;t a necessity, its availability ensures you don&#8217;t have to worry about manually transferring transaction details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-business-savings-account-to-operate-your-profits\"><\/span>2. Business Savings Account to Operate Your Profits<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you look at the corporate account vs personal account, you&#8217;ll find that the former presents you with a better place to operate your profits. It&#8217;s particularly ideal for holding money you don&#8217;t intend to use in the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with these accounts is that they offer limited access. For example, federal regulations state that you can only make six fee-free withdrawals within thirty days. Additionally, many corporate saving accounts don&#8217;t allow you to use ATM cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks offering these accounts may limit the number of deposits made to the account in a month. While they aren&#8217;t as restrictive as business checking accounts, you need to understand all their limitations before operating one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-business-certificate-of-deposit-account-cd\"><\/span>3. Business Certificate of Deposit Account (CD)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CD accounts from Verv are an alternative to business savings accounts. The accounts are <a href=\"https:\/\/verv.novatti.com\/technology\/#:~:text=Unhackable%20%26%20Fortified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unhackable and fortified<\/a> and can earn your company even more money in interest. On the flip side, you shouldn&#8217;t use them to hold the money you intend to use to cover your expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By choosing to open a CD, it means you have agreed not to touch the funds in it for a specific duration. The duration can vary from as little as a few months up to five or more years. Your CD term will influence the interest rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it&#8217;s possible to withdraw funds from the CD at any moment, initiating a withdrawal before its term is up will attract a hefty penalty. Every CD will have a unique formula for determining the penalty to apply to a withdrawal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-business-money-market-account\"><\/span>4. Business Money Market Account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Business money market accounts aren&#8217;t as common as the other corporate accounts mentioned here. On the other hand, these accounts appeal to entrepreneurs who want an account that combines the features of a savings account and a checking account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business MMAs shares many similarities with a savings account. The federal laws regulating the latter are used to regulate these accounts as well. MMAs at times offer better and higher APYs than what you&#8217;re likely to get when using a corporate savings account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional banks are incapable of matching the rates charged by web-based banks due to their substantial overhead costs. Finding an MMA with a higher minimum deposit requirement than a corporate savings account is possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-merchant-account-for-small-businesses\"><\/span>5. Merchant Account for Small Businesses<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A small business that accepts debit and credit card payments may need to operate a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/business\/what-is-merchant-account\/#:~:text=What%20Is%20a-,Merchant%20Account%3F,-A%20merchant%20account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">merchant account.<\/a> The money goes into this account after a customer has made a payment. It then gets remitted to the other linked corporate accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the process may take up to forty-eight hours, you should note that these accounts will typically have their own fees. Some of the fees you can expect to pay to include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Application and set-up fees<br>\u2022 Monthly account maintenance fees<br>\u2022 Per-transaction fees<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before completing the sign-up process, make it a point to familiarise yourself with all the applicable fees. Failure to do so could see you to lose a lot of money. Take your time to read through the fine print and decide whether that&#8217;s the right account for you or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"corporate-account-requirements-what-documents-do-you-need\"><\/span>Corporate Account Requirements \u2013 What Documents Do You Need?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up a corporate account will require you to gather several documents. Examples include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Documentary evidence of address<br>\u2022 Search report<br>\u2022 Two references<br>\u2022 Board resolution<br>\u2022 2 Passport photographs<br>\u2022 Memorandum and Article of Association<br>\u2022 Valid ID of each signatory<br>\u2022 Certificate of Incorporation \/ Business Registration<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"benefits-of-corporate-account\"><\/span>Benefits of Corporate Account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/corporate-account-documents-you-need-640x426-1.jpg\" alt=\"what document you need to open a corporate account with verv\" class=\"wp-image-868\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/corporate-account-documents-you-need-640x426-1.jpg 640w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/corporate-account-documents-you-need-640x426-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a corporate account isn&#8217;t a necessity for small businesses, tradespeople, and independent retailers, but its availability gives you more control over your finances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you compare corporate accounts vs current accounts, there are numerous benefits you will notice in the former. Top among these include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-get-to-simplify-your-yearly-tax-returns\"><\/span>1. Get to Simplify Your Yearly Tax Returns<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A corporate account allows you to separate business expenses from personal ones. It will enable you to sift through your transactions quickly when tax season arrives. And if HRMC ever needs to check your business records, they won&#8217;t have a reason to go through the personal accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your corporate account will hold all the business records they need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-a-business-account-makes-you-appear-professional\"><\/span>2. A Business Account Makes You Appear, Professional.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Supplying customers and suppliers with a dedicated business account will make you look professional in your dealings. Such an account makes your business appear more established and trustworthy than when using personal current accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-build-up-a-credit-rating-for-your-business\"><\/span>3. Build Up a Credit Rating for Your Business<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating a separate corporate account enables the business to build up a credit rating. It&#8217;s a similar type of rating as a personal credit rating and will come in handy when it needs to apply for a company credit card or a loan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business bank account will allow your company to generate an ever-growing credit history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-it-prevents-you-from-breaking-the-t-cs-of-your-personal-account\"><\/span>4. It Prevents you from Breaking the T&amp;Cs of Your Personal Account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most personal bank accounts dictate in their T&amp;Cs that the account holders can&#8217;t use them to run a company. Though the bank will rarely call you out for making a few payments when working as a freelancer, operating a retail business may draw attention to the account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same holds for any entrepreneur running a business that regularly receives and makes <a href=\"https:\/\/verv.novatti.com\/digital-banking-explained-all-you-need-to-know\/#:~:text=later%20can%20make-,payments,-.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cash and debit payments<\/a>. Banks frown upon this practice and may suspend your account or impose penalties for breaking its terms and conditions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-enjoy-the-benefits-of-operating-a-corporate-account\"><\/span>5. Enjoy the Benefits of Operating a Corporate Account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some banks may provide an introductory offer on a corporate account. The offer will vary depending on your account type. A corporate account example introductory offer may include enjoying free banking for a certain duration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others may provide low or free cost electronic transactions, competitive interest on your annual profits, or access to branch-based advisers. It all depends on the type of corporate account you have chosen to operate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"tips-on-managing-a-business-account\"><\/span>Tips on Managing a Business Account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand the various types of corporate accounts available, you should learn how to manage them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Explore different features: Different accounts and different banks will offer varying features. Consider exploring mobile options, international transfers, and savings features.<br>\u2022 Look at the available interest options: Use your company&#8217;s goals to analyse the interest options on offer. Some banking facilities will offer higher rates than others, allowing you to earn more on your savings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"final-words-on-managing-a-business-account\"><\/span>Final Words on Managing a Business Account<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening a business account will provide you with access to incredible benefits.
