Nonetheless, some banks have started operating online strictly. Great examples of this include those facilitating <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift.\">digital payments.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such banks operate in the same manner as traditional banks, the only differences being that:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Clients have to do everything online using a smartphone or computer<br>\u2022 The bank may only have one physical branch or none at all<br>\u2022 Account-holders have to use a debit card to withdraw or spend money<br>\u2022 Bank customers can deposit or make transfers using an app, ATM, or bank website<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some online-only banks also allow their clients to write paper checks. An <strong>internet bank<\/strong> like to boast about how simple it is for their clients to open an online account. Apart from being 18 years, applicants need to provide the following details:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Full legal name<br>\u2022 Date of birth<br>\u2022 Residential street address if applying from the United States<br>\u2022 Tax identification number or Social Security number<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bank may require the applicant to submit a copy of their driver\u2019s license or any other identifying document before making any digital payments. Apart from applying online, applicants can also do so via mail or phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-is-an-internet-based-bank-different-from-a-traditional-bank\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-is-an-internet-based-bank-different-from-a-traditional-bank\"><\/span>How Is an Internet-based Bank Different from a Traditional Bank?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main difference between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ronshevlin\/2020\/03\/16\/whos-better-digital-banks-or-traditional-banks\/?sh=69437ded5660\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an internet-based bank and a traditional brick-and-mortar bank<\/a> is that online banks primarily offer online services. While you won\u2019t get to meet a banker in person, you can access your account anytime using a computer or web-enabled mobile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both banks offer to store and help you manage your money. However, they do vary in terms of the available services, capabilities possessed by each, and the features offered by each bank. While the offerings at each banking facility may vary, the following are their general features:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"traditional-typical-bank-features\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"traditionaltypical-bank-features\"><\/span>Traditional\/Typical Bank Features<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Brick and mortar branches are available<br>\u2022 In-person, online, and phone support<br>\u2022 Higher fees than online banks<br>\u2022 In-person and web-based processes<br>\u2022 Low-interest rates for clients operating savings accounts<br>\u2022 Mobile app and online access are usually available<br>\u2022 Additional fees when making digital payments<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"internet-online-bank-features\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"internetonline-bank-features\"><\/span>Internet\/Online Bank Features<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Don\u2019t have a physical location<br>\u2022 Online customer service, and in some cases over the phone<br>\u2022 Low or no costs when transacting<br>\u2022 Swift and easy online processes<br>\u2022 High-interest rates on checking and savings accounts<br>\u2022 Automatic mobile app and online access<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/secure-payment-gateway.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-386\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/secure-payment-gateway.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/secure-payment-gateway-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/secure-payment-gateway-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-bank-digital-payments-processor\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-to-look-for-in-a-bank-digital-payments-processor\"><\/span>What to Look for in a Bank\/ Digital Payments Processor<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know the differences between these two types of banking facilities, a time will come when you\u2019ll need to choose one. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/things-to-look-for-from-your-online-bank\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Knowing what to look for<\/a> in a bank or digital payments processor can save you a lot of heartache and stress in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you begin your search, you have to understand that there\u2019s no single account that\u2019s right for you. Additionally, there\u2019re lots of factors to consider, and selecting the right bank starts with understanding your personal and banking preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the factors to consider during your search for a bank include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-security-of-your-hard-earned-money\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-security-of-your-hard-earned-money\"><\/span>1. Security of Your Hard-earned Money<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether traditional or internet-based, all banks must be insured by the <strong>United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation<\/strong>. If you prefer banking with a credit union, confirm that the National Credit Union Association insures it.<br>Don\u2019t bank with a facility that doesn\u2019t have this type of protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-customer-support-options-available\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-customer-support-options-available\"><\/span>2. Customer Support Options Available<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a question or problem with your account, the last thing you want to deal with is an unresponsive customer support team. No one wants to sit on hold for hours or have to deal with a customer support representative who is arrogant or unhelpful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conduct a quick search online to see which facilities have the best customer support teams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-banking-fees-and-account-maintenance-fees\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-banking-fees-and-account-maintenance-fees\"><\/span>3. Banking Fees and Account Maintenance Fees<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If possible, focus on finding a bank that will not charge you for conducting basic transactions on your account. Some of the fees you\u2019ll want to avoid at all costs include monthly account fees, fees for account assistance, and per-check fees.<br>All these fees can make your banking experience expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-minimum-balance-requirements-set-by-the-bank\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-minimum-balance-requirements-set-by-the-bank\"><\/span>4. Minimum Balance Requirements Set by the Bank<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Please inquire from the bank on whether you need to maintain a predetermined minimum balance before they can start charging you account fees. While this doesn\u2019t apply to all accounts, some will automatically attract such fees.<br>If a minimum balance is present, confirm that it\u2019s something that you can afford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-what-are-the-applicable-interest-rates\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-what-are-the-applicable-interest-rates\"><\/span>5. What Are the Applicable Interest Rates?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The interest rates charged by banks work both ways: the rates you\u2019ll pay when borrowing via a loan or on credit and the rates the bank will pay when you make a deposit. Ideally, the rates on the deposits should be higher than the charges on your loans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-bottom-line-conclusion\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-bottom-line-conclusion\"><\/span>The Bottom Line\/ Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, which type of bank is better: the internet bank or the traditional bank? The answer is not as simple as you would like, as it depends on your needs. Opt for web-based banks if you want to enjoy low fees and high-interest rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you want to enjoy the ability to make cash deposits and access large amounts of cash fast, stick to the traditional bank. Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to choose during the early days, especially if you already have an account with a typical bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can slowly ease into online banking<\/strong> by using the features provided by your traditional account. Additionally, just because you have opened an online account doesn\u2019t mean you need to close out all your other accounts. Try to leave some money in both accounts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When trying to decide on where to put your hard-earned money, the sky often appears as the limit.
