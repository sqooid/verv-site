Therefore, keep reading to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"digital-payments-what-are-they\"><\/span>Digital payments: what are they?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.managementstudyguide.com\/digital-payments-pros-and-cons.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital payment<\/a> is a transaction happening over online or digital platforms without using the actual exchange of physical currency. In this case, all the parties involved in the transaction use digital platforms to exchange money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, for a successful payment processing between the parties involved, users must have active bank accounts, an active digital payment system, a device to use to process the payment and an intermediary to ensure the transaction is successful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The premise here is that the element of online media has to be present for it to be classified as an online payment. For example, in e-commerce, when you do some online shopping, you only need to input your credit card details and checkout. You don\u2019t need to provide physical money because the transaction is completed online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_1.jpg\" alt=\"Payments Industry\" class=\"wp-image-159\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-are-some-of-the-benefits-of-digital-payments\"><\/span>What are some of the benefits of digital payments?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the world has grown into a global village, more people and organisations look to grow the reach to other countries-mostly online. However, despite the rapid growth of payments solution, there are still some impediments. With the onset of digital payment processing, many of these impediments have been eradicated because they come with various benefits, including :<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Faster transfer rates:<\/strong> Compared to conventional payment solutions, these online financial services are much faster. Today, most businesses happen in real-time, and people need up-to-date cash flows.<br><strong>\u2022 End-to-end security:<\/strong> The emphasis here is on the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">end-to-end security<\/a> aspect that contactless payments offer. These payments are encrypted via different methods to ensure that individuals send or receive their funds securely, without knowing the banking details of the sending or receiving party.<br>\u2022 <strong>Easier currency exchange:<\/strong> It can be challenging to complete payments in local currency when you\u2019re doing international business. However, with such contactless payment systems, you can easily make payments in your local currency. Still, the recipient receives it in their local currency or in whichever form they deem fit. You don\u2019t have to go through the hassle of visiting the central bank to convert your currency.<br>\u2022 <strong>They are more convenient:<\/strong> Using digital payment technologies has made it less cumbersome to transact across borders, eliminating most of the obstacles that have been there before. With the click of a few buttons and the recipient information, you can send huge amounts of money from the comfort of your home to your counterpart in a different location, in a different country.<br>\u2022 <strong>Reduced transfer costs:<\/strong> When you compare the rates for global payments between traditional and digital means, you will realise that it\u2019s cheaper to make mobile payment than using traditional means. Even the conversion costs are lower without necessarily having to compromise on the security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_2.jpg\" alt=\"Payments Industry\" class=\"wp-image-160\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_2.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_2-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_2-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-do-digital-payment-technologies-work-within-the-payments-industry\"><\/span>How do digital payment technologies work within the payments industry?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How you transfer funds to a receiver mostly depends on your service provider. In most cases, these providers rely on the existing payment networks to make things happen, including leveraging payment rails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are basically the payment processing modes for payments including bank accounts, cards, Blockchain or the SWIFT network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After signing up with any of the named payment processors, you select your preferred mode of payment and input the recipient information. It could be using their email address or phone number, and that\u2019s it. You hit send and wait for your payments processor to execute your transfer via your payment rail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it is a digital financial transaction, you can monitor the payment status online in real-time, up to the time the receiver receives the funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_3.jpg\" alt=\"Payments Industry\" class=\"wp-image-161\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_3.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_3-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Payments_Industry_3-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-most-popular-types-of-digital-payment-rails-within-the-payments-industry\"><\/span>The most popular types of digital payment rails within the payments industry.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many different kinds of payment rails you can take advantage of to complete your digital transactions. You only need to consider what works for you, depending on the device you are using or the kind of transaction you want to complete. Here are some of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Cards:<\/strong> They could be classified as the most familiar and simplest form of contactless payments solution. You could either choose to use a credit or debit card to complete your payment in conjunction with your issuing bank. They remain ideal for businesses and are highly convenient because of their ease of use.<br>\u2022 <strong>Digital cheques:<\/strong> Many enterprise-level businesses still opt to use digital cheques for payments in place of physical cheques. They are pretty much the same as physical cheques, only that they are done online. Therefore, they will still leave a paper trail.<br>\u2022 <strong>Wire transfers: <\/strong>One of the easiest ways to send money digital globally using banking institutions. If your bank is part of the SWIFT network, you can easily wire funds to your counterpart. It is a more popular cross-border digital payment method and is ideal for large cash transfers.<br>\u2022 <strong>Wallet payments: <\/strong>These don\u2019t rely on any physical institution because they are purely digital. They are generally fast and easy to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital payments have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bobsguide.com\/articles\/how-have-digital-payments-changed-the-payments-industry\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revolutionised the payments industry<\/a> in more ways than one.
