Essentially, the network channels payment instructions from your domestic bank account to the remitting bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li><strong>SEPA<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Single Euro Payments Area in full, SEPA was created to simplify cross border payments in the form of Euros, especially within the confines of Europe. It is essentially a form of domestic payment method that covers 36 countries, including the UK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works pretty much the same ways as SWIFT does, only that it is only available for Euro payments.

It is pretty simple to use and you will incur very low fees to make international payments. There are unique features that come with it including special savings and investment options.<br>The associated fees with these payment methods<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to transferring money internationally between banks, these are the fees that you should keep in mind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022<strong> Sending fees<\/strong>: The payer\u2019s bank will charge this fee for the international money transfer online<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u2022 <strong>Correspondent banking fees<\/strong>: The intermediary bank will charge this fee in case there is no direct relationship between the banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Receiving fees<\/strong>: The receiving bank charges this fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 <strong>FX fees\/mark-up<\/strong>: This is the fee charged for exchange if the transfer was in different currencies.<br>Processing time for international payments<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, if you have all the details needed for an international bank transfer, you will enjoy the completion of these financial services within the same business day. This is if the transfer was initiated before your specific bank\u2019s cut-off time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, because of time difference in some cases, some transactions may be pushed to the next business day. For instance, in Hong Kong, the cut-off times there vary +\/- 30 minutes from different banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most currencies, the cut of time is 17.30 and the transaction is completed within the same business day like the USD, HKD and CAD. In other cases, the cut-off time can is 17.00 and other cases the transaction is pushed to the next business day like the Swiss Franc (CHF) and Australian Dollar (AUD).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S: When your domestic bank processes your international money transfer on the same business day doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the recipient will receive the funds in their accounts in the same day. It may take 1 to 5 business days to complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"some-factors-that-may-cause-delay-include\"><\/span>Some factors that may cause delay include:<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Regulatory checks<br>\u2022 Destination country<br>\u2022 Time zones<br>\u2022 Bank holidays<br>\u2022 Number of intermediary banks<br>\u2022 Erroneous banking details<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to keep in mind that just like any other kind of transfer, some could be slower than others.
