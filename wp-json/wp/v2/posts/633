A non-bank is typically any FinTech or non-FinTech firm that builds financial products above and beyond the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/the-pros-and-cons-of-online-banking\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"450\">conventional banking<\/a> infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good example of this service is an <strong>online ticketing platform<\/strong>. Naturally, a business\u2019s core function is to boost sales while ensuring there is soaring customer loyalty. To achieve this, there are a number of things the business can do, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Offering loyalty points for each ticket purchase<\/li><li>Issuing customised cards to their customers<\/li><li>Offering one-click loans for any of the upcoming shows<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as these are activities that will directly lead to increased customer satisfaction and sales, you can use these metrics to analyse the buying habits of customers while customising offers to help boost customer loyalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this may seem easy but it\u2019s not entirely the case. Offering such banking services to consumers comes with numerous strings attached, including having a banking or related licenses to offer services like lending assets or deposits. That is where banking as a service comes into play to lessen the hassle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-players-involved-in-baas\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-players-involved-in-baas\"><\/span>The players involved in BaaS<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three major players involved in this kind of financial service:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The bank (modern or traditional)<\/strong>: Your bank will be responsible for providing the physical infrastructure, or otherwise referred to as the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). They are basically the communication hardware and servers. They are important because they already have the required licenses to perform the core banking services. They will rent out these services to the platforms on demand.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The BaaS platform<\/strong>: This platform offers a software that will be used for safe data communication between the FinTech company and the conventional bank, which is referred to as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redhat.com\/en\/topics\/middleware\/what-is-middleware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">middleware<\/a>. These FinTechs will plug into the platform to enjoy the core services without the need for a license. However, there are some platform providers that already have operational banking licenses. Since the platform is API-based, it works as a back-end hosting different FinTechs. However, it calls for close monitoring to ensure it operates securely across the domain.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The company that is looking to integrate FinTech services into their platform<\/strong>: These basically interact with the end-user. They can either be FinTech or not and the customer will be any individual that wants to integrate these services into their product. These firms will plug into the platform to offer some of the core services to their own customers. Therefore, they have to be compliant with the platform\u2019s regulations.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking\" class=\"wp-image-266\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-1024x538.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-300x158.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution-768x403.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/payment_solution.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"some-of-the-functions-baas-providers-perform\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"some-of-the-functions-baas-providers-perform\"><\/span>Some of the functions BaaS providers perform<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Different businesses are implementing this <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">digital payments<\/a> platform into their products. But, what exactly do these platform providers do? Here are some of their core functions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-online-banking\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-online-banking\"><\/span>1. Online banking<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers can enjoy online banking services from FinTech and non-FinTech companies without necessarily having to visit their local branches. Therefore, instead of these firms focusing and spending a lot on integrations and banking licenses, they can shift their focus on how they can improve their services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-offering-debit-and-credit-cards\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-offering-debit-and-credit-cards\"><\/span>2. Offering debit and credit cards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The BaaS-model can be important in allowing non-banks in providing debit and credit cards to their customers. A good example is the <strong>Apple Credit Card<\/strong>. Therefore, customers get to enjoy real-time updates of each transaction via an app displayed in a user-friendly manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such companies can rack up new customers by offering lower interest rates. An incredible way that some businesses use to ensure this is by offering cashback when customers use their debit and credit cards to buy something online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-offering-loans-to-customers\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-offering-loans-to-customers\"><\/span>3. Offering loans to customers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These platforms can also give FinTech and non-FinTech companies to offer loans to their customers. A great example is an airline company offering one-click loans to their frequent flyers to ensure that they enjoy undisrupted travel plans while boosting the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way they offer loans is through offering buy now, pay later options, which enable customers to even schedule their payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-offer-investment-services\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-offer-investment-services\"><\/span>4. Offer investment services<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They can also let consumers invest their assets while automating their finances. Furthermore, they can aid customers to acquire personalised investments with low-cost index funds. At the same time, they can also rebalance their portfolio to ensure that it is consistent with the investment plan of a customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-help-verify-customer-identification\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-help-verify-customer-identification\"><\/span>5. Help verify customer identification<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some transactions can be potentially risky or malicious and may lead to payment transfer failures. When these failures increase, they can lead to huge reputational risk to the business or being branded, <a href=\"https:\/\/infinicept.com\/payment-facilitator\/learn\/get-started\/what-is-the-definition-of-a-high-risk-merchant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high-risk merchant<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, verifying customer identification can ensure there are reduced payment failures, especially when it comes to bulk payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-the-future-of-banking-as-a-service\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"conclusion-the-future-of-banking-as-a-service\"><\/span>Conclusion: The future of banking as a service<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the digital payments landscape is rapidly changing, the concept of BaaS is the reason why businesses have to come to terms with the new reality.
