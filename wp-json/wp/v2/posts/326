At the same time, you have to factor in the aspect of security and convenience for your customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, of course, means that you have to find a payment gateway that stands above the rest. But the question here is, what exactly makes one payment gateway better than the other to ensure that you make the right decision? Continue reading to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Factors making some payment gateways better than others<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As earlier mentioned, it isn\u2019t wise to just go with the first digital payment system you find to secure any financial transaction. In this section, you will learn more about what makes some payment gateways tick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The level of encryption on their systems<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You must appreciate the fact that different payment processors have invested heavily in their various levels and types of encryption to ensure that your transactions are safe. However, you have to sit down and ask yourself whether the encryption standards you are getting are sufficient for the kind of business you are running.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you will be running sensitive payments in your digital payment system, you have to ensure that you go for a payment gateway with the best encryption standards. This is because if you experience even the slightest of breaches, it would be greatly detrimental to your business\u2019s reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things you can consider when it comes to encryption are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 The level of security<br>\u2022 Removal of entire card data<br>\u2022 Tokenization<br>Furthermore, if a payment gateway is more secure, it ensures there\u2019s lowered risk with lower processing costs. Consequently, there are native but seamless integrations into multiple platforms like ERP and accounting, ensuring that payment acceptance is more automated and secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>The available fraud detection parameters and other related features<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Some payment gateways specialize more in <a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10479-021-04149-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fraud detection <\/a>than others. Therefore, they proactively help in the identification of any potential fraud case before it escalates further into the payment process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it would be best for any business that intends to handle large volumes of digital payments to consider such gateways over the basic ones. The better a gateway is at detecting fraudulent online transactions, the better suited it is for any business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li>The related costs and fees<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any other business transaction, it is vital that you consider the related costs and fees for every payment gateway you come across. You may have to keep an open mind here. There are some payment gateways that may offer some incredible features but at even greater costs and fees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, you may find some payment gateways offering zero costs and fees, including setup and monthly fees, but there is a catch. The fee charged for things like chargebacks could be somewhat exorbitant. Also, you can find some gateways that offer flat monthly fees, having no additional fee for some types of transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you also have to understand that higher fees and costs don\u2019t necessarily translate to better services. You have to look at your budgetary needs and the kind of service you expect and choose the gateway that checks all the boxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li>Are they modern or classic?<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This trickles down to your choice and preferences. Would you want something <a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/2015\/07\/payment-gateway-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">modern or classic?<\/a> In the case of classic accounts, you will have to have a direct merchant account. On the other hand, you don\u2019t exactly need a merchant account for any transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, you may find it easier to use modern payment processors, but you will find the fees quite expensive, and your customers may have to be redirected to other sites. This generally reduces conversions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\"><li>The processing speeds<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every payment gateway offers the same speeds. Therefore, it will depend on how much you wish to maximize your average user experience and how fast you wish to complete your transactions. Some gateways are better than others because of how fast they can secure credit card authorization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, such gateways quickly secure funds for the account because there are some that may take up to three days to complete a transaction. If you can get a gateway that can secure payments in just a day and you\u2019re running a start-up, why would you want to consider one that would take you up to three days?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"6\"><li>Comprehensive reporting features<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>One payments solution offer <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/technology\/#:~:text=Reporting%20and%20compliance%20%2D%20Create%20automated%20reports%20and%20get%20valuable%20insights%20to%20improve%20your%20regulatory%20compliance.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pretty comprehensive reporting features;<\/a> that is why they tend to sell more than others. However, it all depends on the kind of report on want on things like reviewing transactions and related aspects like the received chargebacks, comprehensive analysis of fees incurred, if any, or the review of the commissions received if you are a retailer. It all depends on the types and formats of reports a gateway offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inasmuch as some of these features make some payment gateways better than others, it would be best to keep in mind that there is no one perfect gateway suited for businesses. You only need to look at your business needs and find one that works best for you in accepting digital payments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction With the flood of multiple payment gateways in the payments industry, it can be pretty challenging for merchants to settle on one gateway to secure their digital payments.
