They include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your industry: Healthcare companies, financial companies, and FinTech firms typically offer the best returns on investment. They are, therefore, an attractive equity financing option for most investors.<\/li><li>Your existing network: The question here is one, &#8220;which circles are you associated with?&#8221; If you know many people, the better your chances of meeting people who can assist you in finding investors.<\/li><li>The amount of money needed: <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\">Digital payment<\/a> startups should concentrate on equity financing. Such companies require vast amounts for office space, development, and talent. Consider debt financing if the company is already operational.<\/li><li>How soon you need the money: Consider internet debt financing if you don&#8217;t have much time. Alternative lenders can make the funds available in as little as twenty-four to forty-eight hours.<\/li><li>What ownership percentage do you want to retain? Working with part-owner investors may limit your decision-making capability, making it harder to achieve your goals.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-ways-to-finance-your-banking-as-a-service-business\"><\/span>5 Ways to Finance Your Banking as a Service Business<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-friends-relatives-and-angel-investors\"><\/span>1. Friends, Relatives, and Angel Investors<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from personal savings, friends, relatives, and angel investors often act as the primary go-to option for anyone looking to start a business. But for this method to work, the people you&#8217;re approaching must trust you and believe you&#8217;re a reliable person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking for financing from people in your life can prove scary for any person. Money has the potential to ruin relationships if a person isn&#8217;t careful. Make sure to set repayment timelines for the people you approach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, consider offering them a percentage of the revenue you&#8217;ll receive from the business within the first few years. You shouldn&#8217;t let your poor investment decisions ruin long-term friendships. Always communicate clearly on how you intend to use this money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-credit-cards-and-lines-of-credit\"><\/span>2. Credit Cards and Lines of Credit<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Credit cards and personal lines of credit serve as a good financing option for companies that would like to charge expenses now and pay the debt later. And this is not forgetting that such cards can pay you back in the form of cash backs, miles, or points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s not recommended to use credit cards to finance your <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/banking-as-a-service-progress-continues-as-banking-is-made-less-difficult\/#:~:text=is%20because%20of-,banking%20as%20a%20service,-(BaaS)%20that%20there\">banking as a service startup<\/a> if you can&#8217;t differentiate between them. You may not know this, but there exists a major difference between individual and business credit cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a personal credit card to finance your operations may prove messy when the time comes to file your annual business returns. Ensure that you use the personal credit card for personal expenses and vice versa.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll also want to read the fine print for the credit card. Pay specific attention to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Card benefits, e.g., shopping protections and premium travel benefits<\/li><li>Introductory and regular APRs for balance transfers and purchases<\/li><li>Rewards program<\/li><li>Annual fees<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-banking-as-a-service.jpg\" alt=\"business banking as a service\" class=\"wp-image-784\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-banking-as-a-service.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-banking-as-a-service-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/business-banking-as-a-service-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-banking-as-a-service-financing-from-venture-capitalists\"><\/span>3.

Venture capitalists are mainly interested in tech-driven companies and companies with high growth potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VCs will primarily focus on funding companies in biotechnology, information technology, and digital payments. When funding your startup, the venture capitalists will want to take an equity position in the firm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will take up this position to aid the coming execute a promising but risky project. You&#8217;ll need to give up a stake in your company to get funding. Most venture capitalists earn a return on their investment when the business begins selling shares to the general public.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, they possess knowledge and experience which will help your business operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-strategic-or-private-partnerships-with-other-brands\"><\/span>4. Strategic or Private Partnerships with Other Brands<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Entering into a strategic partnership with another company can provide your <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/what-does-a-banking-as-a-service-provider-do\/#:~:text=as%20a%20service%20(-,BaaS,-)%20frequently%20in%20the\">banking as a service<\/a> platform with access to new goods and services. Increased access to innovative products and new markets can make it easier to increase customer loyalty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can also enable you to overtake your more established competitors. The challenge lies in identifying your clients&#8217; pain points and finding a partner that can help you meet them. Any agreement you sign should benefit both companies equally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let your business purpose determine the partnerships you form.

Peer to Peer Lending (P2P)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Peer-to-peer loans allow startups and established businesses to seek funding from investors using specialized online borrowing platforms. Applications are speedy, with decisions on loans being communicated within a few minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your funding request gets approved, the money gets disbursed faster than it would have if you had borrowed from a bank. The terms associated with P2P lending are typically more flexible, and the length can vary from a month to five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to these loans is the typically fixed repayments, which can significantly impact internet businesses. Although the APR for peer-to-peer lending is low, startups may have difficulty securing funding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before funding, some investors will need to know how much a business makes per year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"why-startups-have-a-hard-time-getting-financing-from-banks\"><\/span>Why Startups Have a Hard Time Getting Financing from Banks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Small businesses and startups have a hard time accessing capital for several reasons. Many assume it&#8217;s because banks have stringent requirements, but this is not all. Traditional banks employ labour-intensive regulations and lending processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These processes are often unfavourable to small organizations which require quick funding to remain afloat. Another factor is that most small businesses are merely starting and don&#8217;t have extensive profit and loss statements to show to the banks to prove profitability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"advantages-offered-by-alternative-lending-to-banking-as-a-service-businesses\"><\/span>Advantages Offered by Alternative Lending to Banking as a Service Businesses<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Small businesses can benefit in several ways by considering alternative lending in place of traditional banks. Borrowing from non-traditional sources, such as those mentioned above, lets you enjoy access to a robust and highly invested partner(s).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These partners have connections to the media, industry analysts, other contacts, and even new clients. By opting for alternate lending, you get to enjoy benefits such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relatively hands-off partnership: They will leave you to manage the day-to-day operations and only come in when there are major decisions you need to make.<\/li><li>Market credibility: Your market gets to benefit from the goodwill that the partner has already built for their business. Partnering with a strong brand will lend weight to your business.<\/li><li>Overall business guidance: Their investment in your company may involve joining its board of directors.
