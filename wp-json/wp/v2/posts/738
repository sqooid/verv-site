You want speed, value, security, or all three combined, but there are charges involved. It\u2019s therefore wise to be keen regarding charge fees which are a percentage of the amount transferred or a flat rate. The exchange rate is also another hidden charge since some providers don\u2019t publish it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also consider the limits on the amount you can send overseas, whether minimum or maximum. Sometimes, this is to comply with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/financial-services\/currency-exchange\/international-money-transfers\/cheapest-way-to-send-money-abroad\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">international banking regulations<\/a>. These limits can apply to each transaction or cumulatively over a specific period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major factors you\u2019ll consider is the length of time your money takes to reach your family or friends abroad. It could be instant in the sense of banking-as-a-service apps or over several days, and faster services may attract an extra convenience fee. Some money transfer services require that the recipient have an account to receive when you send money to family overseas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others will allow specific destination or pickup locations where your friend or a family member has to appear physically, such as Western Union. Some service providers may also not operate in certain countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-are-the-different-options-for-sending-money-overseas\"><\/span>What Are the Different Options for Sending Money Overseas?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You must be familiar with the options available when you want to send money to family or friends in another country. While banks still dominate the number of providers, specialized money transfer operators or MTOs are rapidly evolving to close the gap. Online payment services with their digital applications charge lower fees and electronic transfers are almost instant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The different ways you can transfer money to your friends abroad include;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"transfer-money-through-banks\"><\/span>Transfer Money Through Banks<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks have the longest establishment in the financial service provider sector and are therefore deemed safer than recent upstarts. Some of these traditional institutions have their histories dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. To make money transfers abroad, you can use several services offered by your bank, including;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 In branch transfers<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Telephone banking<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Online transfer portal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To send money overseas through a bank, you should have an account with that institution. Your recipient family or friends abroad can receive those funds personally or, in some instances into their mobile wallet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re sending money abroad using your bank, keep an eye out for transfer fees, which can go up as high as \u00a330 in extreme cases. Banks typically offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/sending-money-to-family-and-friends-fast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">poor exchange rates<\/a>, often above 5% over mid-market rates. Speed is also slow, with transfers taking three to five days depending on the country you\u2019re remitting to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-operators.jpg\" alt=\"send money transfer operators\" class=\"wp-image-808\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-operators.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-operators-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/send-money-operators-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"using-money-transfer-operators\"><\/span>Using Money Transfer Operators<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get efficient international money transfer and payment services with speciality operators such as OFX, TransferWise, TransferGo, and InstaReM. These companies have reduced over-reliance on banks, providing a competitive space in the funds\u2019 remittance space. Not only has that brought down prices, but your recipient gets the funds in their bank accounts, cards, mobile wallet, or at a cash pickup point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Money transfer operators are prolific online, and they have agencies that you\u2019ll find on the high street or within your bank\u2019s branch. They accept cash deposits or transfers from your bank account, credit, or debit card. You can also make your transaction on the web via the MTOs site or mobile app, giving you convenience with minuscule costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Money transfer operators are fast, safe, and have a variety of options for sending money abroad in comparison to banks. Besides their lower transfer fees, you\u2019ll pay exchange rates at 1% margins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"cash\"><\/span>Cash<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can send money abroad in cash, albeit electronically, as one of the most practical and old-fashioned ways of transferring funds to your family or friends. Companies like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Ria allow you to walk into any of their service points or agent locations that make remittances for transfer. Your recipient receives the funds within minutes at a specified collection point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some countries, cash is sent to your recipient\u2019s home address, especially where the population is <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-to-transfer-money-internationally\/\">under-banked or unbanked<\/a>. It also serves older family members well, seeing as they may have difficulty getting to the pickup location. Some drawback of these services includes steep money transfer fees and poor exchange rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"international-money-orders\"><\/span>International Money Orders<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the most reliable and safe ways to send money abroad, you\u2019ll pay a certain amount to receive a printed international money order. You\u2019ll then mail this to your recipient, who can cash it out at a designated bank or post office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can buy international money orders at any post office and most banks. However, other than relying on \u2018snail mail\u2019 in regards to speed and security, the order may not be supported in your recipient\u2019s country. While there\u2019s no maximum amount of money sent, you\u2019ll have to confirm your identity for any order above \u00a3700.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exchange rates on international money orders are above market, while issuing and processing fees can be high depending on the country you send the funds to. They guarantee payment, and your friends or family abroad don\u2019t need a bank account to cash them. If the order gets lost in the mail, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/electronic-funds-transfer-benefits-security-cost\/\">replacements and cancellations<\/a> tend to cost more and consume time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-has-digital-banking-simplified-the-process-of-sending-money-abroad\"><\/span>How Has Digital Banking Simplified the Process of Sending Money Abroad?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the definition of a bank has undergone severe disruption, and having physical branches is no longer an essential part of the package. Online only and neo banks have moved into the foreign exchange space with seamless Banking as a Service or BaaS solutions. If you are sending money abroad, digital banking offers low-cost and sometimes free transfers that your recipient gets almost instantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your financial provider\u2019s digital banking app eliminates the need to make person-to-person payments when you\u2019re sending money to friends. To send money to friends overseas, these tools ensure convenience, speed, and security at reasonable exchange rates and low transfer fees. As long as you\u2019re online on mobile or desktop, their services are available 24\/7, and you can make remittances whenever you need them at any time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best digital banking user interfaces will allow you to view your transaction history save recipient and payment details for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ofx.com\/en-us\/personal\/finances-abroad\/sending-money-to-family-abroad-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">easier repeat transfers<\/a>. You can also integrate several clever tools into your online application, such as alerts for currency exchange rates. A push notification is sent to your phone via email or text when the rate is at a desirable level to add value to your money transfer abroad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"you-can-send-money-abroad-using-your-mobile-banking-application\"><\/span>You Can Send Money Abroad Using Your Mobile Banking Application<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, remitting funds overseas isn\u2019t dissimilar to transferring cash domestically.
