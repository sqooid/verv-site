Tech advancements have made it easier for the world to embrace payment methods that use machine learning\/AI and smartphone apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past two years, the fear of germs, global lockdowns, and the ease of online shopping has helped increase the adoption of banking as a service platform. Gen Z, for example, has quickly <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/domestic-vs-international-payments-differences\/#:~:text=Today%2C%20digital-,payments,-have%20made%20it\">embraced online payment<\/a> methods such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Buy now, pay later (BNPL)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Electronic wallet services<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Peer-to-peer payment apps<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Contactless payments<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As competition in this sector continues to intensify, the addition of value-added services can assist payment processors in differentiating themselves from their competition.

Payment processing has become interconnected in the same way the world has done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a look at the top digital payment methods of 2022<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-devices-that-use-biometric-authentication\"><\/span>1. Devices that Use Biometric Authentication<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>eCommerce customers have gone digital with their purchases, which has led to the need for increased security. Biometric authentication can assist in preventing identity theft and fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the items used to verify the identity of a user include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Vein mapping<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Fingerprint scanners<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Heartbeat analysis<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Iris recognition<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Facial recognition<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many apps used to make international and domestic payments, e.g., Google Pay and Apple Pay, rely on facial and fingerprint recognition. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, as several other options are already in the pipeline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Visa has announced plans to pilot a biometric payment card. The card will require users to touch a sensor placed on the card to verify a transaction. If successful, users will no longer need to sign receipts or use PIN codes to complete payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments.jpg\" alt=\"mobile payments\" class=\"wp-image-781\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/mobile-payments-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-mobile-payment-apps-mobile-point-of-sale-mpos\"><\/span>2. Mobile Payment Apps\/ Mobile Point of Sale (mPOS)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile payment apps make it easier for smartphone users to make international and domestic payments. All they need is a tablet or smartphone to <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/electronic-funds-transfer-benefits-security-cost\/#:~:text=The%20electronic-,fund%20transfer,-process%20in%20the\">transfer funds<\/a> to a company or individual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top peer-to-peer apps recorded double-digit growth in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. The trend continued in 2021, with up to 30% of American adults signing up on emerging P2P platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the most commonly used payment methods in America include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Google Pay<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Cash App<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Zelle<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 PayPal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Venmo<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses need to invest inconvenient payment processing as the number of mPOS users will only continue to rise. Adopting these solutions will enable them to accept payments from any location and eliminate the need to use a central checking-out area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-contactless-payments-as-digital-payment-methods\"><\/span>3. Contactless Payments as Digital Payment Methods<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s practically impossible to talk about digital payments today without mentioning contactless payments. The last year has seen a rapid increase in mobile payment apps that enable users to pay for goods at the tap of a finger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers love contactless payments as they are faster and deemed more secure than the traditional PIN technology. Devices using this technology get to transfer the data on a real-time basis to the point-of-sale system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who want to use this technology have two options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I. Use digital wallets\/mobile apps<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;II. Wave a credit\/debit card across a card reader<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second option has become possible due to the availability of RFID technology. Some cards, however, rely on near-field communication (NFC) technology to process contactless payments. Apart from being fast, they are also convenient for the consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-from-cards-to-codes\"><\/span>4. From Cards to Codes<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A random combination of digits present on a card was used to recognize a bank account in the past. But the last few years have seen <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/thesba\/2013\/03\/07\/emv-chip-technology-secure-electronic-payments-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EMV technology<\/a> slowly pick up and begin introducing consumers to more secure and computerized payment methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) has a reputation for using codes that changes every time a user makes a transaction. The reliance on these temporary codes assists in boosting the security of the attached bank accounts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a solid example of how codes can assist in reshaping how consumers get to manage their bank accounts. Additionally, emerging technologies will likely overshadow existing plastic cards and offer better and more convenient payment methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-cards-credit-cards-and-debit-cards\"><\/span>5. Cards \u2013 Credit Cards and Debit Cards<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/credit-cards\/why-every-purchase-should-be-on-a-credit-card\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Credit cards and debit cards<\/a> have been around for many years. They are the simplest and most common form of making international and domestic payments by far. Nearly every person has one, and it is often issued when opening checking accounts at a bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals and businesses can use these cards in many different ways, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;I. Reading the credit\/debit card number over the phone<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;II. Inserting or swiping at a payment terminal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;III. Submitting the 16-digit code to a web portal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Card-related digital payments are best used by small to medium-sized enterprises looking to pay for goods through merchant portals. If you have to make a card payment, confirm that the mediums in use have PCI DSS compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6-smart-speakers-home-assistants-payments\"><\/span>6. Smart Speakers\/ Home Assistants Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart speakers, also known as home assistants, e.g., Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod, and Google Home, can help you make international and domestic payments using voice commands. These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johnkoetsier\/2020\/08\/08\/alexa-siri-google-assistant-how-the-top-smart-assistants-stack-up\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home assistants<\/a> use P2P solutions to transfer funds from one account to another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although their adoption has peaked in the last two years, most homeowners are still sceptical about them. Analysts believe that their uptake will increase by the end of 2022. Depending on your assistance, it\u2019s possible to make a voice pin on the system to enhance security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the voice pin to buy goods and services online, including clothing, groceries, and home care products. Looking at the growth potential of these smart speakers, eCommerce store owners should consider optimizing their online stores for voice search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7-digital-payments-via-social-media\"><\/span>7.

Social networking platforms are slowly expanding their reach to support money transfers between the network and other parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many millennials today turn to social networking platforms whenever they need to make a purchase. Some <a href=\"https:\/\/animoto.com\/blog\/news\/audience-watching-discovering-buying-2020#:~:text=Here%20are%20a%20few%20highlights,a%20new%20brand%20or%20product.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies<\/a> have shown that some millennials make purchase decisions based on the type of presence that a brand has on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook all provide business accounts that brands can use to connect with and sell goods to social media users. Such accounts support digital payments, which brands can use for a small fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-importance-of-digital-payment-methods\"><\/span>The Importance of Digital Payment Methods<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The interconnection of world economies has made it necessary for companies to find a way to use banking as a service platform to pay vendors. And though there exist barriers that have made it harder to move money across borders, digital payments can help eliminate them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronic fund transfer processes, for example, have assisted in eliminating several physical barriers linked to international payments. Some of the obstacles they have helped overcome include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Currency exchange: The use of local currencies can make it harder for a company to pay vendors and get paid. Transactions involving local currencies may raise questions like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>o Which currency should you use when making payments? Yours or theirs?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>o Should you convert the funds before or after sending the payment?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022 Transfer rate: It takes a few business days for the money to reach a recipient using traditional channels. With digital payments, the recipient can have the money in their hands within a few minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"the-takeaway-on-digital-payment-methods\"><\/span>The Takeaway on Digital Payment Methods<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers can now make international and domestic payments using any of the seven methods mentioned above.
