Its purpose can include authorizing, instructing, or ordering a banking facility to debit or credit a given account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process has earned several names over the years. For example, it goes by a giro transfer in Europe, bank transfer in the United Kingdom, and e-check in the U.S.<br>Examples of digital payments that qualify as an EFT include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Instant payments<\/li><li>Direct deposits<\/li><li>Direct debits by a cashier<\/li><li>ATM transfers<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"electronic-funds-transfer-eft-advantages\"><\/span>Electronic\u00a0Funds Transfer EFT Advantages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/payment_trend1.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Banking - EFT - Electronic funds transfers\" class=\"wp-image-603\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/payment_trend1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/payment_trend1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/payment_trend1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1-customers-have-a-right-to-dispute-these-digital-payments\"><\/span>1. Customers Have a Right to Dispute These Digital Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers who have recently completed an EFT payment have a right to raise a dispute with the merchant. You&#8217;re allowed to ask the bank to investigate any transactions that appear unauthorized or incorrect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Payment processors typically give their clients a total of sixty days to dispute any claims they may notice on their statements. This protection, combined with other features of electronic fund transfer, assists in protecting you against any type of financial fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial institutions recommend that you review all your monthly statements on arrival. A systematic review will ensure you remain protected against any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/elizahaverstock\/2021\/12\/03\/fintechs-fraud-problem-why-some-merchants-are-shunning-digital-bank-cards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">illegal or unauthorized transactions<\/a> that third parties may try to sneak past you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2-efts-enable-merchants-to-access-their-funds-much-faster\"><\/span>2. EFTs Enable Merchants to Access Their Funds Much Faster<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, on this list of <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/eft-electronic-funds-transfer-overview\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"728\">Electronic Funds Transfer<\/a> EFT advantages is merchants&#8217; easy access to cash. Merchants using this method of funds transfer get to enjoy numerous unique benefits such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Reduced risk of fraud.<\/li><li>Eliminates the time spent to complete a payment to employees.<\/li><li>It reduces or entirely does away with some bank fees.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The above benefits also benefit their clients as they help minimize price increases linked to high transaction fees. For example, it takes one to two business days to complete a wire transfer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>International digital payments may take between three to four business days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3-customers-can-pay-for-their-shopping-without-physical-access-to-a-debitcredit-card\"><\/span>3. Customers Can Pay for their shopping without Physical Access to a Debit\/Credit Card<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantage you need to note is that businesses will generally accept electronic conversion as a payment form. And this is despite many of them refusing to accept the standard check.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a customer, it means you can purchase items that you couldn&#8217;t buy if you didn&#8217;t have a credit card with you. Banks have no problem accepting digital payments as the Money will come from the associated bank account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that customers don&#8217;t have a risk of incurring debt when using digital payment processors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4-you-have-an-option-to-setup-automated-payments\"><\/span>4. You Have an Option to Setup Automated Payments<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/banking\/your-complete-guide-to-direct-deposit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACH payments<\/a> typically provide users with a chance to create automated payments. However, you&#8217;ll be glad to note that standard electronic funds payments can also help you achieve this fete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens is that a merchant gets to automatically pull funds from your bank account whenever your bill with them becomes due. Often, this occurs every month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The merchant gets to initiate the transaction, which means you as a customer won&#8217;t need to intervene or complete any steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated payments are ideal for individuals with a hectic lifestyle. It ensures you never forget to make payments, allowing you to keep your billing up-to-date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that the payment processors will require you to complete some paperwork before benefiting from these Electronic Funds Transfer <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/electronic-funds-transfer-benefits-security-cost\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"500\">EFT advantages<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, you can stop these payments whenever you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-many-eft-based-payments-dont-require-a-hold-on-the-money\"><\/span>5. Many EFT-Based Payments Don&#8217;t Require a Hold on the Money<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have used EFT payments understand how fast this money moves from one account to another. Their fast nature is among the Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantages you get to enjoy as a user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recipients aren&#8217;t required to wait for these funds to clear to make a withdrawal or use them online. With traditional checks, recipients may have to wait for up to fourteen days before using these funds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a merchant, this can prove disastrous as it may take them weeks to realize that a check didn&#8217;t clear. EFT payments allow merchants to use their funds immediately after the payment instead of waiting for the go-ahead from the clearing bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5-its-safe-to-receive-funds-sent-using-the-eft-process\"><\/span>5. It&#8217;s Safe to Receive Funds Sent Using the EFT Process<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s generally considered safe to use Money that has been sent to you using the EFT process. Such payments are certain because banks will only complete transactions when the sending account has enough money in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Money becomes yours to use as soon as it arrives in your account. It usually takes a few hours to reflect on your account, although there are instances when it may take longer. Furthermore, a sender can&#8217;t recall the Money after sending it to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts in the banking industry recommend that you begin by verifying that the funds are real before attempting to access them. If you can, contact someone at the banking facility to establish whether the funds cleared as expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to reverse certain types of electronic payments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7-digital-payments-are-available-globally\"><\/span>7. Digital Payments are Available Globally<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, many people are using payment processors to send Money to different locations worldwide. Although specific processors offer this service, you can also send funds from a credit union or your local banking partner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its global availability is one of the Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantages that you can&#8217;t afford to take for granted. Some online providers have made it convenient to a point where one doesn&#8217;t need to leave their home or office to transfer funds to a person in a different country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s more, most urban cities have multiple centres that accept electronic fund transfers. It benefits the average consumer who doesn&#8217;t have to travel for many kilometres to locate a merchant who can help them send or receive cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also the added benefit of receiving money in your local currency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"are-businesses-required-to-offer-eft-services\"><\/span>Are Businesses Required to Offer EFT Services?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it&#8217;s not mandatory for you to operate a cash-based service, the modern business environment calls for you to accept several forms of payment. Accepting digital payments can help open up your services to more customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it makes sense to link your business to multiple payment processors, given that most people prefer to pay using cards. Refusing to accept credit card payments may limit your selling potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also necessitated the need for people to go cashless. EFT payments have made this possible.
