The exponential growth of <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell\/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payment processors<\/a> like Stripe and PayPal has played a significant role in driving many innovations in the payments industry, which has contributed to the huge market gains and incredible valuations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of this growing trend in the payment processing industry is banking as a service (BaaS) and the pandemic acted as a great catalyst.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, even with this growth in digital payments, the underlying question remains- just how much will such FinTechs disrupt customers\u2019 banking choices existent for centuries? Yes, the changes are here already, but how does it affect service availability and reliability? Read on to learn more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"what-is-the-difference-between-open-banking-and-baas\"><\/span>What is the difference between open banking and BaaS?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Open banking is very different from banking as a service in a digital payment system. The primary difference between these two is that banking as a service is a payments solution falling under open banking. Generally, it is a strategy banks and FinTechs use to work together to ensure that there is an integrated experience for banking customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to BaaS, third parties take advantage of the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to gain access to some of the already existing functions of a conventional bank. When they tap into such functionalities, they can provide enhanced, simplified or different services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, open banking is essentially the framework that makes it possible for BaaS to exist. Therefore, through open banking any payment solution will obtain market guidelines on how any third party can gain access to this consumer data, process it and use it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The logic behind this in digital payments is that customers are the information owners. Therefore, as a result of some politically established regulations, this type of banking encourages more open markets to ensure they stay competitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"how-baas-affects-the-consumer-and-the-market\"><\/span>How BaaS affects the consumer and the market<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a plethora of FinTechs worldwide, which means the competition in the online payment industry is very stiff. In the UK alone, there are over 1600 payment solution providers, making it a major <a href=\"https:\/\/codeandpepper.com\/fintech-accelerators-in-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">FinTech hub globally<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such numbers are ideal for sustaining competition; this, spawning innovations. When you look at the UI\/UX pricing, design models that explain different data sets and how they relate to saving and saving, you will see how such numbers are vital. When companies integrate API development, they essentially connect with conventional banks, they can easily download and process data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it only means that digital engagement is going to be critical. It may pose significant challenges for companies offering credit cards like Apple and Monzo. Using a credit card won\u2019t make much sense if you can just you your face or thumbprint. This means different firms will have to coin ways to encourage customers to directly interact with their innovations. It all lies in the customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1.jpg\" alt=\"BaaS\" class=\"wp-image-576\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1.jpg 800w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"a-comparison-of-banking-as-a-service-providers\"><\/span>A Comparison of Banking as a Service Providers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many FinTechs are rapidly adopting platform-based banking to enjoy significant benefits.
