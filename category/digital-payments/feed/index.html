<p>Today, business managers are opting to use a leadership style that assists in empowering their employees. An example of empowerment in leadership is when a manager encourages personnel to become independent instead of merely delegating responsibilities.</p>



<p>Typical benefits of <strong>empowerment in business</strong> include increased trust, creativity, personal and professional growth, and overall employee satisfaction. But how can managers empower their personnel and reap the benefits of empowerment? Read on to learn more!</p>



<h2>What is Business Empowerment Meaning?</h2>



<p>Business empowerment refers to a philosophy designed to encourage personnel to make decisions on their own. Supervisors ought to provide their people with the support needed to make them confident in their work positions.</p>



<p>Standard empowerment in business examples <strong>encourages managers</strong> to desist from micromanaging workers. They encourage those in charge to provide their juniors with the autonomy to flourish under their guidance.</p>



<h2>What Is Employee Empowerment?</h2>



<p>In this case, an employee <a href="http://localhost:8080/5-ways-to-finance-your-business-online/#:~:text=looking%20to%20start%20a-,business,-.%20But%20for%20this">running a business</a> empowerment fund who makes a mistake gets encouraged to view their mistakes as a learning lesson. By encouraging employees to take risks, you&#8217;re giving them a chance to grow.</p>



<h3>How to Empower Your Employees?</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/top-5-verv-features-every-business-need-1200x806-1-1024x688.jpg" alt="Best Features of Verv - Business" class="wp-image-1005" width="512" height="344" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/top-5-verv-features-every-business-need-1200x806-1-1024x688.jpg 1024w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/top-5-verv-features-every-business-need-1200x806-1-300x202.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/top-5-verv-features-every-business-need-1200x806-1-768x516.jpg 768w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/top-5-verv-features-every-business-need-1200x806-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure>



<p>If you operate a business or manage personnel in a business, you have to understand that its success depends on your team&#8217;s performance. When you empower them, they get to grow professionally and begin working harder, enabling the business to grow.<br>So, what does <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/09/22/10-ways-you-can-start-empowering-your-employees/?sh=483a5df57af0#:~:text=key%20driver%20for-,empowerment,-.%20-%C2%A0Loren%20Margolis%2C%C2%A0Training" target="_blank" rel="noopener">empowerment</a> in business examples look like?</p>



<h3>1. Mentor Employees Through their Mistakes</h3>



<p>When running a business empowerment fund, such as the <a href="http://localhost:8080/business-account/#:~:text=BUSINESS%20ACCOUNT-,Corporate%20Accounts,-With%20VERV%2C%20being">corporate accounts</a> from Verv, it&#8217;s normal to expect mistakes to happen. As a manager, you need to empower your people to accept their mistakes. Use this as a learning opportunity to guide them on what to do.</p>



<p><strong>Mentoring your employees</strong> through their mistakes will give them room to grow. When sustained, it will assist in creating an organizational culture of resilience and growth.</p>



<p>Though it can prove challenging, you can use these tips to coach employees through a mistake:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avoid pointing fingers: While you need to point out what went wrong, avoid getting carried away, as this may lead to finger-pointing. Instead, focus on what went wrong and what the employee can do in the future to prevent such mistakes.</li>



<li>Keep your emotions in check: Your attitude towards your people&#8217;s failure will determine if and when that employee will bounce back. Take time to deal with your negative emotions before approaching the employee at fault.</li>



<li>Show the employees what went wrong: Assisting your people to see what went wrong will make it easier to recover from failure. Try to hold a frank and honest discussion with your employees without sugarcoating the issue at hand.</li>



<li>Give your employees some elbow room: All the people working for you need some room. Allow them enough room to work, even after making a mistake. If you crowd their space in an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2020/07/16/13-telltale-signs-that-a-manager-is-micromanaging-their-team/?sh=2b7148491ccb#:~:text=2020%2C01%3A10pm%20EDT-,Micromanagement,-might%20sound%20like" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempt at micromanagement,</a> the employees will resent you.</li>
</ul>



<h3>2. Ensure You Start with a Clear Vision</h3>



<p>Attracting personnel aligned with the <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">purpose of your payment gateway</a> is an excellent way to assist them in feeling empowered to contribute to your goals. From here, you need to assist them in setting professional goals that will tie their success to that of your company.</p>



<p>Doing this means that whenever they work on a Verv <strong>business account</strong>, they will feel that they are doing something fulfilling. Remember to include measurable steps in your vision to help your people get to where they need to go.</p>



<h3>3. Delegate Work and Responsibility</h3>



<p>Empowerment and delegation in the business environment go hand in hand. When an employee understands their responsibilities, they begin taking ownership of what they are doing.</p>



<p>In the long-term, this will allow you to reduce <strong>micromanagement</strong>, allowing you to manage their work even less. Delegation is a show of faith in what the employees are doing, and it tells them that you trust them to get things done.</p>



<h3>4. Give Your Employees Boundaries</h3>



<p>Giving your employees boundaries is an ideal example of empowerment in leadership. The limits you define will enable the employees to make decisions on their own. They will base their decisions on the guidelines you have specified.</p>



<p>Defining boundaries provides them with the freedom to make choices. Some managers think that boundaries can hold employees back, but <strong>boundaries help empower them</strong>. They give them a say in different situations, some of which would have required them to consult you.</p>



<h3>5. Adopt an Open-Door Policy for Your Office</h3>



<p>As a manager, you want your employees to understand that their opinions matter. Leaving your office door open is one of those empowerments in business examples every manager should emulate.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a policy that tells your employees that you value them and what they have to say. While it may seem like a simple gesture, it will motivate them to communicate their input. The employees will start to play a more active role in the business.</p>



<h3>6. Build Strong Relationships with Your Employees Based on Mutual Trust</h3>



<p>Business empowerment means building solid <strong>relationships </strong>with your people based on mutual trust. You have to remember that employees now have lots of choices regarding employment options.</p>



<p>Employees want to advance their careers, but they would rather do it in a fun place. You&#8217;ll want to keep them engaged and regularly let them know that they form a crucial part of the business mission.</p>



<p>Ensure you choose the right people for every project.</p>



<h3>7. Focus on Connection and Employee Growth</h3>



<p>The best business leaders focus on elevating the people they work with, including those around them. Unlike managers, leaders have to endeavour to create a business environment that&#8217;s inclusive and generally positive.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an environment that should bring out the best in the people who work with them. Cultivating genuine connections will result in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/12/18/working-toward-a-common-goal-how-to-maintain-team-alignment-in-your-startup/?sh=5676e48b18af#:~:text=Working%20Toward%20A-,Common,-Goal%3A%20How%20To" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common unifying goals,</a> as it will motivate the employees to become more engaged.</p>



<h3>8. Ensure Your Employees Have the Resources they Need</h3>



<p>Merely showing your employees the pool doesn&#8217;t mean they are ready to swim unsupervised. Develop a wealth of tools and resources and show the employees how they can use them to improve their work.</p>



<p>The tools and resources should remain available throughout, allowing them to use these tools whenever the need arises. While at it, try to encourage open communication and inform your team that you&#8217;re always open to engaging in a <strong>brainstorming session</strong>.</p>



<h3>9. Work to Earn Their Trust</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s easy to support your people during good and peaceful times. But this doesn&#8217;t mean that you should become unreachable when the times become stormy. Many managers tend to annihilate their people when the times are rough.</p>



<p>You shouldn&#8217;t hire people to manage your business empowerment fund unless you&#8217;re willing to support them through thick and thin. While you&#8217;re probably relying on other business tools to manage customer loyalty, you shouldn&#8217;t take for granted the role played by your employees.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll foster unwavering loyalty in your team as you continue to earn their trust. These are people who will want to work for you, which will, in turn, enable you to achieve your <a href="https://speed.cy" data-type="URL" data-id="https://speed.cy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business goals</a>.</p>



<h3>10. Supporting Vacation Time as Part of Empowerment in Business Examples</h3>



<p>Although this may seem counterintuitive, the reality is that your employees will give you their best efforts when they are well-rested. <strong>Burned-out</strong> employees are unproductive, unhealthy, and lack focus to get the job done.</p>



<p>Learn to spot the burnout symptoms and encourage employees to take advantage of their vacation days. Employees will become more productive when they are rejuvenated and relaxed.</p>



<p>While you don&#8217;t have to mandate a couple of weeks at a time, try to foster a work environment that supports a long weekend every once in a while. Tolerating and actively supporting vacation time will go a long way in helping you reap the benefits of <strong>empowerment in business</strong>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[People send money abroad for different reasons. But before you can initiate an EFT, there are a few things that you should know. Read on to learn more!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Individuals commonly send money abroad for different purposes, e.g., remitting money to family or paying employees in a different country. If youâ€™re an ex-pat, you may want to do this when buying a car or a house in your new country of residence.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/sending-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, you should know a few things before using banking as a service platform to remit money. These will include your rights, the information the platform should provide, and how to compare costs.</p>



<p>Apart from your rights, thereâ€™s a need to learn about the different platforms available and how each operates. Most importantly, you should know that remitting funds internationally depends on whether you want to value, security, speed, or a blend of all three.</p>



<h2>Send Money Abroad: 6 Things You Need to Know Before You Do </h2>



<h3>1. The Laws in The Country of Residence</h3>



<p>Sending funds abroad isnâ€™t a crime, but it may become one if you arenâ€™t careful. Organized crime syndicates have used <a href="http://localhost:8080/the-simple-guide-on-electronic-funds-transfers/#:~:text=economy%20relies%20on-,digital%20payments,-.%20This%20means%20that">digital payments</a> for money laundering purposes for years. The situation has forced local law enforcement to formulate laws to prevent such crimes.</p>



<p>Fraud, racketeering, and tax evasion are serious crimes that attract severe penalties. Failure to observe laws governing international money transfers can lead to your arrest. You can protect yourself from this by keeping abreast of all money transfer laws in your country.</p>



<p>For example, learn whether your country of residence has placed a cap on the amounts permissible for transmission without tax forms. Others may require you to file a report even when performing a one-time transaction.</p>



<h3>2. Available Money Transfer Options</h3>



<p>Banks were once the only option available to individuals looking to send money. Today, this is no longer the case, thanks to the emergence of cheaper and <a href="http://localhost:8080/send-money-abroad-the-best-options-out-there/#:~:text=Cheaper%20and%20flexible%20options">more flexible options</a>. Below is a look at some of these options:</p>



<p>â€¢ Verv: Individuals with Verv personal accounts can send money abroad to over 120 countries. It has some of the most competitive rates in the money transfers market while protecting your account with password-less biometric authentication.</p>



<p>â€¢ PayPal: The giant money transfer company easily beats its peers with its fast services. All you need to send funds is an account on the platform. The recipient will receive the funds instantly and transfer them to their bank account the next day.</p>



<p>â€¢ Wise: Formerly known as TransferWise, Wise has the best exchange rates in the industry. Its upfront fees are low and allow you to remit funds to over 70 countries. Same-day delivery services are available, while bank transfers may take a few days.</p>



<h3>3. Exchange Rates</h3>



<p>Before using <a href="http://localhost:8080/baas-explained-comparison-of-baas-service-providers/#:~:text=processing%20industry%20is-,banking%20as%20a%20service,-(BaaS)%20and%20the">banking as a service</a> platform to remit money, make sure you know the prevailing exchange rates. Every money transfer platform will provide a different exchange rate, making it necessary to compare what each offers.</p>



<p>Itâ€™s not uncommon to come across meagre exchange rates on some platforms. Platforms may offer low rates to enable them to profit from the transaction. Take your time to compare the rates on offer.</p>



<p>If youâ€™re unsure of what to do, visit their official websites and compare the rates listed with those on Google. Other comparison sites include XE and other platforms offering the same remittance service. Remember, the higher the rate, the money a recipient will receive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research.jpg" alt="research how to send money abroad" class="wp-image-789" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>4. Service Charges on Offer</h3>



<p>Most money remittance companies claim to have the lowest fees in the market to attract more users. Banks apply the same approach when marketing their remittance services. However, you shouldnâ€™t let these marketing gimmicks fool you!</p>



<p>Digital payment companies, banks, and <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">payment gateways</a> arenâ€™t required by law to reveal what happens behind the scenes during the transfer process. The trick lies in knowing what questions to ask before you transact.</p>



<p>Determining the exchange rate the platform will use on your transaction can allow you to learn a few truths. For example, you should walk away from a platform that offers a low rate but doesnâ€™t charge any service fees.</p>



<p>Why You Need to Walk Away</p>



<p>You stand a better chance with a company that charges a fixed service charge per transaction. Such banking as a service platform will offer an exchange rate thatâ€™s either high for each dollar or reasonably close to the mid-market rates.</p>



<p>While at it, establish whether the amount you get after multiplying the amount sent with the exchange rate matches what the recipient will receive. If you learn that the platform will subtract a separate fee on the receiving end, this can reduce the amount received.</p>



<p>Experts refer to this technique as â€˜adding an under-serviced charge.</p>



<h3>5. Reputation and Security of the Banking as a Service Platform</h3>



<p>Security is always an issue when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dealing with EFTs</a>. While banks are traditionally secure, they arenâ€™t the first choice for sending money abroad. It would help if you looked into the security of every platform under consideration.</p>



<p>For example, focus on the website security of currency specialists and money transfer platforms before signing up. Check whether they have data protection measures, e.g., encryption standards, to protect the data from getting intercepted.</p>



<p>Inquire from family and friends on which options are the best. While at it, confirm that your bank details wonâ€™t get revealed or sold to third parties. Check the address bar to confirm that it starts with HTTPS or has a green lock button before the URL.</p>



<h3>6. The Transfer Speed</h3>



<p>Just because you want to send money to another country doesnâ€™t mean it should take long to reach the recipient. Apart from security and the exchange rate, the speed at which the recipient will receive the money also matters.</p>



<p>A speedy transfer is necessary as an emergency might occur at any moment. Confirm with the service provider the number of hours or days it will take for the recipient to receive the money.</p>



<p>Please note that some platforms provide a higher rate for speedy transfers. Others may charge higher transaction costs for the same service. Choose a platform that wonâ€™t take too long to deliver the funds where theyâ€™re needed.</p>



<h2>Risks When Sending Money Abroad</h2>



<p>Now that you know what you need to know before sending money abroad, itâ€™s time to look at the potential risks of such a transaction. The options listed earlier are safe and secure, but international transactions arenâ€™t without risks. Such risks can include:</p>



<p>â€¢ Exchange Rates: Most money remittance platforms will lock in a rate once they have sent you a quote. If possible, try to remit the funds using the recipientâ€™s currency. Where this is impossible, take your time to understand all the applicable fees.</p>



<p>â€¢ Delays: Delays are common even when dealing with established and reputable companies. Although they can occur for several reasons, the company should have a compensation policy in place in case of delays.</p>



<p>â€¢ Applicable Limits: Research the transaction limits put in place by each platform. Some are best for large transfers, while others will charge you favourably for smaller transactions. Research in advance to avoid getting disappointed at the last minute.</p>



<h2>Details Needed to Send Money Abroad</h2>



<p>Regardless of the method or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/sending-money-to-family-and-friends-fast/#:~:text=You%20only%20need%20the%20receiver&#039;s,to%20check%20before%20sending%20money." target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform</a>, you want to use to send money, youâ€™ll need to have specific details with you. These will include:</p>



<p>â€¢ Address and name of the recipientâ€™s bank</p>



<p>â€¢ Full name and address of the receiver</p>



<p>â€¢ The International Bank Account Number</p>



<p>â€¢ The BIC/SWIFT code of the receiving bank</p>



<p>â€¢ Reason for sending the funds, e.g., work expenses, medical funds, etc.</p>



<p>As you can see, there are a lot of details you need to know before you can use banking as a service platform to remit funds. Though the process may appear complex, knowing whatâ€™s expected of you can make it faster, secure, and cheaper.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/payment_gateway1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-282" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/payment_gateway1.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/payment_gateway1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/payment_gateway1-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>1. Data Cybersecurity as a Ranking Factor</h3>



<p>The practice of reducing cyber risk by protecting the IT infrastructure of an enterprise is called cybersecurity. Such a framework includes data systems, software, and hardware profiles for which you must ensure confidentiality, security, and integrity.</p>



<p>Securing private data is the main component of cybersecurity, where resources, methods, and many tools are used to increase cyber resilience.</p>



<p>Data or information is the most lucrative piece that hackers seek when attacking the security integrity of your company. Data security management revolves around data management and encompasses risk assessment to ensure that information is secure.</p>



<p>Make Verv your company&#8217;s cybersecurity solution provider, and we employ Blockchain and link-building strategies that can help you set up the ideal data protection system.</p>



<h3>2. Integrating Security Solution Practices into Your Business</h3>



<p>Your business can adopt practices that may involve a change in organizational strategy while re-evaluating other policies. There should be planning and preparation for a cyber-attack or data breach.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/30/14-top-data-security-risks-every-business-should-address/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business continuity management</a> will oversee the resumption of revenue-generating operations, while a disaster recovery responds to the vulnerabilities with remedial tactics.</p>



<p>Adverse data security problems and solutions susceptibility events can include application or system fault and human error in codes, scripts, or configurations. With the right solution provider, your business will withstand cyber-attacks and recover from malware damage by malicious attackers.</p>



<p>While many disciplines complete many data securing approaches, our traditional ones are constantly evolving. Let Verv make essential considerations to integrate cybersecurity practices for data protection into your organization successfully.</p>



<h3>3. Identifying Possible Data Security Threats</h3>

<p>Getting your payment cards into peoplesâ€™ wallets is hard. Even if you design your own debit card well, many things are involved in ensuring the process is successful. The most important thing is usually to have the prepaid debit card institution sign on it. You canâ€™t just go to the card network, get a merchant number, and start accepting credit cards.</p>



<p>The bank has to decide if youâ€™re creditworthy, which means that they have to decide whether to trust you. If youâ€™re a small business with no track record, they might not want to lend you anything. They might want you to prepay some amount of money against future sales.</p>



<p>Credit card institutions like to work with already established businesses, but this does not mean that your business transaction wonâ€™t be effective as a startup company. <a href="http://localhost:8080/about/">Verv</a> is here to assist all companies that need support and friendly fees to provide their services. But if you need your own payment card, below is a step-by-step guide to ensure the process is successful.</p>



<h2>A Step By Step Guide On How To Get Your Payment Card</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/banking-2.jpg" alt="Digital Banking cards " class="wp-image-672" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/banking-2.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/banking-2-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/banking-2-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>Step 1: Select your Debit Card Processor</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.fintechna.com/press-releases/defi-project-kingswap-launches-visa-debit-card-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa debit card</a> is the most common, and many businesses and individuals hold Visa credit card. But if you want to select other options, you are free to do so as there are others like American Express and MasterCard. These two are also internationally used. Apart from that, credit unions and banks around you can sponsor you.</p>



<p>The debit card processors provide reliable payment options and the right amount of security needed to allow your customers to make transactions stress-free.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Get a Simple Design for Your Debit Card</h3>



<p>Just like business cards, you can also design your own debit card. Today, it is easy to do that, thanks to the high-tech and easy-to-use online websites that offer brilliant images. You do not have to make complicated designs for your debit card. A simple image representing your company will do.</p>



<p>For example, the Stripe debit card has its business logo on the front part and, on the other side, a few details about the cardholder. Whichever design your select, ensure the card is presentable. The images and colours you select should match your company.</p>



<h3>Step 3: Have a Fee Structure</h3>



<p>Now that you have your companyâ€™s debit card, you must make it easier for customers to use the card. Be it a virtual credit card or a physical one, the fee structure of your company should be well defined. Remember, you will be making money from the services you provide based on the charges you have presented to your customer.</p>



<p>Ensure you research the required or standard fees you should charge. If the credit card fees are high, many customers will shift to cards that offer affordable fees.</p>



<h3>Step 4: Include the Terms and Conditions</h3>



<p>As you create your own debit card company, do not forget to include the terms and conditions to allow customers to understand how transactions occur in the company. This will provide your customers with the trust they need. Some of the things to include in the terms and conditions sections are;</p>



<ul><li>Annual fee</li><li>Transaction fee</li><li>Balance transfer</li><li>Minimum interest charge</li><li>Annual percentage rate, etc.</li></ul>



<p>Ensure to include anything that you feel is important for the customers to know in regards to the payment policy of the company. This not only allows you and your customers to meet at a common ground. It also prevents future conflicts from arising.</p>



<h3>Step 5: Start Marketing Your Cards</h3>



<p>This is usually the most challenging step as your mission is to get the cards in the customerâ€™s wallet. It is not as easy as it may seem. You need a good strategy to encourage your customers to use your companyâ€™s debit card.</p>



<p>It is important not to flood the cards in the market because many people might reject them. Instead, you can provide a free debit card to anyone who wants your services. Apart from that, you can hire freelance marketers to spread your companyâ€™s message.</p>



<h3>Step 6: Get a Private Label Relationship</h3>



<p>Most businesses that run their own debit card always find it to be costly. Luckily, you can partner with private label debit card companies to ease the burden on your startup.</p>



<p>This will help save money, and the good thing is that the card will still hold your business logo. Besides that, monthly fees and long-term commitments will be lifted off your shoulders as you focus on growing your business. Lastly, register your business to companies that will help you manage business assets.</p>



<h2>How to Ensure You Get Approved for a Payment Card</h2>



<p>Getting your own payment card can sometimes be challenging as a few things need to be polished to qualify for the card. The good news is that you can always improve your chances of getting approved by doing the following:</p>



<h3>Ensure Your Company Has a Good Credit Score</h3>



<p>Assume that you are going to borrow a loan from the bank. The first thing they will check is your credit score. This is to affirm that you will manage to pay the loan when the due date arrives.</p>



<p>It is the same as applying for a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/best/business-cards-for-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business debit card</a>. Any bank or sponsors you will be partnering with want to ensure that your business can sustain the debit cards while driving profits to your organization.</p>



<h3>Clear All your Debts</h3>



<p>It is crucial to pay all your debts to have a good relationship with the bank. This will make it easier for the bank to sponsor you. Remember, it is all about creating trust.</p>



<h2>Importance of Having Your Companyâ€™s Debit Card.</h2>



<p>To make your business grow, you need to be able to accept credit cards from your customers. Customers love the convenience of being able to pay with their cards. So why not take advantage of this? Here are some reasons why you should get a debit card for your business:</p>



<ul><li>It is easy to use. You can just swipe the customerâ€™s card and enter the amount you will charge them for their purchase.</li><li>It is fast and convenient for both you and your customers. This means that they will be able to make their purchases in less time, which means more money for you!</li><li>Another reason why itâ€™s important is that if there is an issue with a payment made by debit or credit card, it can easily be resolved without having to go through all of the hassle involved in dealing with banks and other financial institutions that normally handle such issues.</li><li>It also gives consumers peace of mind knowing that their personal information will never be leaked</li></ul>



<h2>Business Debit Cards: Are They Worth the Hassle?</h2>



<p>Debit cards eliminate the need to carry cash or physical checks to make purchases. This makes them outstanding, fun, and easy to use, but are you really prepared for the annual and management fees that come with having your own companyâ€™s payment card. If not, do not worry because Verv offers an entire payment ecosystem to let your business grow.</p>



<p>It allows you to have a business and personal account, and the fees are very affordable, which is suitable for small businesses. But all in all, you can still design your own debit card to generate more customers for the business. It is worth the hassle.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantages are many and mainly target consumers who don't want to use cards. Their fast nature makes them quite popular. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>These transactions can occur between accounts held in the same bank or multiple payment processors. Every aspect gets handled by a computer-based system.</p>



<p>As such, employees working for the <a href="http://localhost:8080/why-traditional-banks-need-financial-technology/" data-type="post" data-id="147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial institution</a> don&#8217;t need to intervene for the transactions to go through.</p>



<h2>What Is Eft in Banking?</h2>



<p>Before you can learn about the Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantages, you need to know what EFT means.</p>



<p>According to The <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/caletters/2008/0807/08-07_attachment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978</a>, this is a money transfer initiated by magnetic tape, telephone, electronic terminal, or computer. Its purpose can include authorizing, instructing, or ordering a banking facility to debit or credit a given account.</p>



<p>The process has earned several names over the years. For example, it goes by a giro transfer in Europe, bank transfer in the United Kingdom, and e-check in the U.S.<br>Examples of digital payments that qualify as an EFT include:</p>



<ul><li>Instant payments</li><li>Direct deposits</li><li>Direct debits by a cashier</li><li>ATM transfers</li></ul>



<h2>ElectronicÂ Funds Transfer EFT Advantages</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/payment_trend1.jpg" alt="Digital Banking - EFT - Electronic funds transfers" class="wp-image-603" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/payment_trend1.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/payment_trend1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/payment_trend1-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>1. Customers Have a Right to Dispute These Digital Payments</h3>



<p>Customers who have recently completed an EFT payment have a right to raise a dispute with the merchant. You&#8217;re allowed to ask the bank to investigate any transactions that appear unauthorized or incorrect.</p>



<p>Payment processors typically give their clients a total of sixty days to dispute any claims they may notice on their statements. This protection, combined with other features of electronic fund transfer, assists in protecting you against any type of financial fraud.</p>



<p>Financial institutions recommend that you review all your monthly statements on arrival. A systematic review will ensure you remain protected against any <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/12/03/fintechs-fraud-problem-why-some-merchants-are-shunning-digital-bank-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal or unauthorized transactions</a> that third parties may try to sneak past you.</p>



<h3>2. EFTs Enable Merchants to Access Their Funds Much Faster</h3>



<p>Second, on this list of <a href="http://localhost:8080/eft-electronic-funds-transfer-overview/" data-type="post" data-id="728">Electronic Funds Transfer</a> EFT advantages is merchants&#8217; easy access to cash. Merchants using this method of funds transfer get to enjoy numerous unique benefits such as:</p>



<ul><li>Reduced risk of fraud.</li><li>Eliminates the time spent to complete a payment to employees.</li><li>It reduces or entirely does away with some bank fees.</li></ul>



<p>The above benefits also benefit their clients as they help minimize price increases linked to high transaction fees. For example, it takes one to two business days to complete a wire transfer.</p>



<p>International digital payments may take between three to four business days.</p>



<h3>3. Customers Can Pay for their shopping without Physical Access to a Debit/Credit Card</h3>



<p>Another Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantage you need to note is that businesses will generally accept electronic conversion as a payment form. And this is despite many of them refusing to accept the standard check.</p>



<p>As a customer, it means you can purchase items that you couldn&#8217;t buy if you didn&#8217;t have a credit card with you. Banks have no problem accepting digital payments as the Money will come from the associated bank account.</p>



<p>It also means that customers don&#8217;t have a risk of incurring debt when using digital payment processors.</p>



<h3>4. You Have an Option to Setup Automated Payments</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/your-complete-guide-to-direct-deposit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACH payments</a> typically provide users with a chance to create automated payments. However, you&#8217;ll be glad to note that standard electronic funds payments can also help you achieve this fete.</p>



<p>What happens is that a merchant gets to automatically pull funds from your bank account whenever your bill with them becomes due. Often, this occurs every month.</p>



<p>The merchant gets to initiate the transaction, which means you as a customer won&#8217;t need to intervene or complete any steps.</p>



<p>Automated payments are ideal for individuals with a hectic lifestyle. It ensures you never forget to make payments, allowing you to keep your billing up-to-date.</p>



<p>Please note that the payment processors will require you to complete some paperwork before benefiting from these Electronic Funds Transfer <a href="http://localhost:8080/electronic-funds-transfer-benefits-security-cost/" data-type="post" data-id="500">EFT advantages</a>.</p>



<p>Luckily, you can stop these payments whenever you want.</p>



<h3>5. Many EFT-Based Payments Don&#8217;t Require a Hold on the Money</h3>



<p>Those who have used EFT payments understand how fast this money moves from one account to another. Their fast nature is among the Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantages you get to enjoy as a user.</p>



<p>Recipients aren&#8217;t required to wait for these funds to clear to make a withdrawal or use them online. With traditional checks, recipients may have to wait for up to fourteen days before using these funds.</p>



<p>For a merchant, this can prove disastrous as it may take them weeks to realize that a check didn&#8217;t clear. EFT payments allow merchants to use their funds immediately after the payment instead of waiting for the go-ahead from the clearing bank.</p>



<h3>5. It&#8217;s Safe to Receive Funds Sent Using the EFT Process</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s generally considered safe to use Money that has been sent to you using the EFT process. Such payments are certain because banks will only complete transactions when the sending account has enough money in it.</p>



<p>The Money becomes yours to use as soon as it arrives in your account. It usually takes a few hours to reflect on your account, although there are instances when it may take longer. Furthermore, a sender can&#8217;t recall the Money after sending it to you.</p>



<p>Experts in the banking industry recommend that you begin by verifying that the funds are real before attempting to access them. If you can, contact someone at the banking facility to establish whether the funds cleared as expected.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible to reverse certain types of electronic payments.</p>



<h3>7. Digital Payments are Available Globally</h3>



<p>Today, many people are using payment processors to send Money to different locations worldwide. Although specific processors offer this service, you can also send funds from a credit union or your local banking partner.</p>



<p>Its global availability is one of the Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantages that you can&#8217;t afford to take for granted. Some online providers have made it convenient to a point where one doesn&#8217;t need to leave their home or office to transfer funds to a person in a different country.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, most urban cities have multiple centres that accept electronic fund transfers. It benefits the average consumer who doesn&#8217;t have to travel for many kilometres to locate a merchant who can help them send or receive cash.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s also the added benefit of receiving money in your local currency.</p>



<h2>Are Businesses Required to Offer EFT Services?</h2>



<p>Although it&#8217;s not mandatory for you to operate a cash-based service, the modern business environment calls for you to accept several forms of payment. Accepting digital payments can help open up your services to more customers.</p>



<p>Additionally, it makes sense to link your business to multiple payment processors, given that most people prefer to pay using cards. Refusing to accept credit card payments may limit your selling potential.</p>



<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also necessitated the need for people to go cashless. EFT payments have made this possible. Looking at the aforementioned Electronic Funds Transfer EFT advantages, there&#8217;s no reason for your business not to go digital!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When it comes to international payments, there are many different ways to send money from one country to another. Learn about them here!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This article discusses international banking transactions and highlights the fees and duration to complete the transaction. It also gives an example of understanding the process as a payment solution.</p>



<h2>How to understand international banking transactions</h2>



<p>International transactions involve agreements that require settlement in <a href="http://localhost:8080/blockchain-based-payments-security-analysed/" data-type="post" data-id="126">foreign currency</a>. An international payment solution relies on digital payments to enhance bank transactions across national borders.</p>



<p>International banking involves transactions related to the acceptance of deposits and loans anywhere in a currency different from the country in which the bank is located.<br>These banking processes are used to:</p>



<ul><li>Facilitate international wire transfers</li><li>Facilitate cross-border payments after trade purchases</li><li>Facilitate digital payments by connecting payment gateways to the bank</li></ul>



<h2>A look into all about cross-border payments</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/key-players-in-payments.jpg" alt="banking" class="wp-image-818" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/key-players-in-payments.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/key-players-in-payments-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/key-players-in-payments-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Cross-border payments involve funds paid to or taken in from different countries. The e-commerce world contributes to these bank transactions through:</p>



<ul><li>Payments</li><li>Remittances</li><li>Purchases</li></ul>



<p>These cross-border payments compose international financial transactions. Hence, the requirements for an international transaction include the following:</p>



<ul><li>A change of currency</li><li>Foreign transaction fees</li><li>Exchange rates</li></ul>



<h2>International wire transfers in international financial processes</h2>



<p>International wire transfers via the bank are costly. Financial institutions approximate a high fee that can be applied while sending or receiving an international wire transfer.</p>



<p>Banks charge a higher markup in converting the currency rates. The banks charge a percentage of the total wire transfer amount.</p>



<p>International wire transfers take approximately two working days. It depends on the bank and the recipientâ€™s destination.</p>



<p>Wire transfers are secure methods to make payments. The requirements for a wire transfer include:</p>



<ul><li>Receiving the bankâ€™s name and address</li><li>SWIFT address</li><li>ABA number</li><li>Sellerâ€™s name and address</li><li>Bank account title</li><li>Account number</li></ul>



<h2>A look into the foreign banking transaction process</h2>



<p>Foreign banking procedures require a correspondent bank and a respondent bank. The transaction process begins with the following steps:</p>



<ul><li>The funds leave the senderâ€™s bank to go to the recipientâ€™s bank.</li><li>In most cases, it&#8217;s a merchant&#8217;s bank that receives the remitted bank.</li><li>The funds are settled into the merchantâ€™s account</li><li>The factors involved in the transaction include navigating currencies, varying taxes, and transaction fees</li></ul>



<h2>How to send money abroad via foreign banking</h2>



<p>Foreign banking procedures require consideration of factors in <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-to-transfer-money-internationally/">money transfers</a> such as:</p>



<ul><li>The exchange rate. The difference in exchange rates varies with the countries. The bank can provide the exchange rates for comparison with other banks before transactions</li><li>The amount of money you wish to transact.</li><li>The transfer fees</li></ul>



<h2>An elaborate example of a cross-border banking transaction</h2>



<p>International transactions describe digital payments to reduce banking transaction complexity.</p>



<p>You can be based in London and purchase an outfit from an online merchant based in Brazil. During the online purchase process, you receive a prompt for your address and credit card information which you submit. Upon entering your payment information online, the money from your bank in London (the correspondent bank) communicates with the correspondent bankâ€™s presence in Brazil.</p>



<p>It reduces the complex nature of these bank transaction types.</p>



<h2>International transactions through banking explained</h2>



<p>Digital bank accounts contribute to the transfer of money across borders rapidly and safely. These accounts suit the needs of the consumer. They reduce banking transaction complexity by using digital money transfer accounts.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://localhost:8080/international-payments-local-vs-digital-banking/">digital money transfer</a> accounts include:</p>



<ul><li>PayPal â€“ a digital platform for international transfers</li><li>WorldRemit â€“ which has low fees, and no hidden costs</li><li>Verv â€“ which only uses the web service for an international bank transaction</li></ul>



<h3>Fees required during these banking processes</h3>



<ul><li>Sending fees that are charged by the payerâ€™s bank</li><li>Correspondent bank fees. The intermediary bank charges it if there is no direct relationship between the banks</li><li>Receiving fees that are charged by the receiving bank</li><li>Mark-up that is charged for exchange if the transfer is in different currencies</li></ul>



<h2>How long do these financial transactions take?</h2>



<p>You can complete these international transactions within the same business day. It depends on the time of the transaction. However, the time difference can make some transactions go over to the next day.</p>



<p>Other reasons that the transaction can delay include:</p>



<ul><li>The destination country</li><li>Regulatory checks</li><li>Number of intermediary banks</li><li>Bank holidays</li><li>Errors in the banking details</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Payment processors in enhancing international financial transactions</strong></h2>



<p>Many factors integrate to contribute to the comprehension of digital payments and foreign banking proceedings.</p>



<p><a href="http://localhost:8080/payment-processors-how-they-affect-your-business/">Integration of payment processors</a> simplifies these banking undertakings in the following ways:</p>



<h2>Accepting credit and debit card payments</h2>



<p>The processor enhances digital payments through linking bank accounts internationally and expanding outreach and trade-in businesses.</p>



<h3>Provide alternative payment options to international transactors through platforms like PayPal, Stripe, and the likes.</h3>



<p>The third-party applications ease the transfer of payment from the sender to the receiver bank. These banking transfers become easy and practical through international financial transactions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The world is currently undergoing significant changes due to technological advancements. Most activities conducted manually are now going online. Most businesses are launching online platforms to <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-to-transfer-money-internationally/">reach clients globally</a>. Accepting digital payments is one of the ways to expand your business to reach a global scale.</p>



<p>The ability of clients to make online payments when buying goods has several benefits to both the consumer and the business. The <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/2019-payments-study-20191219.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> discovered that automated payment processors are more popular than cheque payments.</p>



<p>The number of <a href="https://www.paymentscardsandmobile.com/half-of-global-consumers-comfortable-making-digital-payments-after-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debit and credit card payments</a> increased by 9% annually from 2015 to 2018. The rate doubled in 2020 after the Covid 19 pandemic. Most people prefer making online credit card payments when purchasing goods. Some businesses are phasing out offline cash payments and are adopting credit card payment methods.</p>



<p>When setting up or reviewing your business, it is essential to consider your current payment channels. Shifting to online payment allows your business to cope with the changing environment and stay on top. Some of the most common online payment channels clients can use to make cross-border purchases include:</p>



<ul><li>International transfer services</li><li>Bank to Bank orders</li><li>International wire transfer</li><li>Digital banking</li><li>Multi-currency debit cards</li></ul>



<p>Below are the main reasons for businesses to take credit card payments online.</p>



<h2>Main Reasons Why Online Credit Card Payments are better than Offline Cash Payments</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bank-loans-for-lenders.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-772" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bank-loans-for-lenders.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bank-loans-for-lenders-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bank-loans-for-lenders-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h2>Online Credit Card Payments are quick</h2>



<p>One of the best things about <a href="http://localhost:8080/electronic-funds-transfer-benefits-security-cost/">digital payments</a> is speed. Incorporating digital payment processors assists customers in completing their transactions fast. They do not have to carry large sums of money when visiting your business premises.</p>



<p>Offline cash payments are slow since you will have to recount the money before entering the value into the system. It wastes time and energy for both the customer and business owner.<br>Cheques are also slow since they take several days to mature. It might take longer if the information given was wrong. Business owners also have to verify the cheque before banking it. This process is slower, especially when receiving several payments.</p>



<p>When you accept online credit card payments, transactions become faster. Customers purchasing goods only need to enter their card details when shopping online. Clients can also swipe their cards on the digital payment processors when purchasing from a local store. After swapping, the total amount is transferred from the customerâ€™s account directly to your business account.</p>



<p>It helps save time and makes cash flow seamless regardless of the business type.</p>



<h2>It provides a High Level of Convenience</h2>



<p>Digital payments are more convenient than cash payments, especially when receiving large sums. Consumers find it convenient to pay online when buying expensive commodities such as electronics, cars, or homes.</p>



<p>Carrying that entire amount is difficult for customers. Digital online systems do not require you to count the money since it transfers it directly to your business account.</p>



<p>Clients will prefer businesses with digital payment systems due to convenience. It also increases your scope since people can perform cross-border payments when ordering goods. It also increases the number of sales made every day hence boosting your business.</p>



<h2>Online Credit Card Payment is Secure</h2>



<p>Clients feel more secure when paying via digital platforms rather than offline cash payments. It is difficult to track payments made using physical cash, and in case of fraud, one cannot recover it. Walking around with lots of cash makes one a target to criminals. Storing cash in your business makes it vulnerable to theft or misplacement.</p>



<p>Cheques are also not an exception to fraud. Identifying a fake cheque from a real one is not easy. You will have to visit the bank for verification hence consuming more time. Cheques are also likely to bounce, forcing you to cancel the clientâ€™s order. Frequent cancellation affects the overall business performance.</p>



<p>Despite digital payments being a target to hackers, the funds remain protected by financial institutions. One can recover the money in case of theft by cybercriminals. Digital payments also take time to verify any online transaction made. The transaction will also be unsuccessful if the amount of money in the customerâ€™s account is not enough.</p>



<h2>It helps in Business Monitoring</h2>



<p>Record keeping and tracking are easy when using digital payments. Every time a customer pays using a credit or debit card, the system automatically adds the total amount. It also helps track expenses when ordering goods. With these online digital processors, it is easy to identify the profits made by the company.</p>



<p>Online payments also <a href="http://localhost:8080/business-finance-solutions-to-manage-cash-flow/">allow you to monitor</a> the traffic into your business, whether online or physically. It provides you with details of all people who purchased products from your store.<br>It helps you identify the most preferred goods by customers. This information helps you when making your order. In turn, it helps build a good relationship with your clients.</p>



<h2>How can you make Credit Card Payment Method Effective?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/02/16-ways-to-make-digital-payment-methods-more-effective/?sh=3552af826a70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>, businesses can adopt the following methods to encourage customers to use credit card payments when purchasing goods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As an entrepreneur running an eCommerce platform, your main concern lies in ensuring that the clients are protected at all times. It doesnâ€™t matter whether youâ€™re running a booking platform or an eCommerce one.</p>



<p>You have to ensure they have access to secure <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">digital payment</a> solutions. When using an existing system, you must confirm that the solution can meet your business needs. While at it, it should also satisfy all customer requirements.</p>



<p>Did you know that the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/10/09/six-ways-to-reduce-cart-abandonment/?sh=5247a5901d9c#:~:text=the%20average%20online-,cart%20abandonment,-rate%20currently%20stands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average cart abandonment rate</a> currently stands at 70%? The reality is that clients will abandon their carts if the checkout process proves lengthy and complex. Integrating an international payment solution into a site makes it look secure.</p>



<h2>Best International Payment Gateway â€“ What Are Payment Gateways?</h2>



<p>eCommerce vendors typically collect payments online using <a href="http://localhost:8080/5-step-guide-to-secure-online-card-payments/#:~:text=secure%20an%20online-,payment%20system,-to%20protect%20their">payment processors</a> and a merchant account. The merchant account is simply an account capable of accepting credit card payments.</p>



<p>The payment gateway acts as a link between the online store/website and the merchant account. As you continue with your research into payment gateways, there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself:</p>



<ul><li>How much do the payment processors charge in terms of transaction and merchant fees?</li><li>Is there a list of products that I canâ€™t sell via the said gateway? For example, certain processors wonâ€™t allow merchants to use their platforms to sell guns.</li><li>Does the gateway charge different rates for different credit debit cards? For example, are there cards that attract higher transaction fees than others?</li><li>Which countries does the gateway support?</li><li>What are the applicable rates and fees for all back-office payments?</li><li>How does the company address customer complaints?</li></ul>



<p>eCommerce vendors have tons of gateways to choose from today. Excellent <a href="http://localhost:8080/electronic-funds-transfer-benefits-security-cost/#:~:text=either%20originate%20from%20a-,payment,-terminal%20or%20the">international payment</a> systems examples include Authorize.net, Square, and PayPal. Read on to learn how the payment gateways work.</p>



<h2>How Do the Digital payments Systems Work?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mobile-payments.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-781" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mobile-payments.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mobile-payments-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mobile-payments-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Before you can learn how payment processors work, you should start by getting an idea of what they are and what they do. In this case, an online payment system refers to a process that facilitates the payment of goods and services purchased online.</p>



<p>The systems typically comprise the merchant account, payment processor, and payment gateway. Hereâ€™s a little more information on how they work to assist in simplifying things for you:</p>



<ul><li>I. Payment Gateway: As seen earlier, gateways are go-betweens between a payment processor and a merchant account. Itâ€™s tasked with handling the technical aspects of the cardholder information transfer. It ensures that each transaction gets completed securely and quickly.<br></li><li>II. Payment Processor: Theyâ€™re essentially third parties whose job is to manage the card transaction process. Their job is to communicate the clientâ€™s card details with their bank and the merchant bank. Payment will only complete if they have enough funds in the account.<br></li><li>III. Merchant Account: As mentioned earlier, itâ€™s a unique bank that accepts all card payments. eCommerce vendors canâ€™t accept digital payments without this account. Itâ€™s why you need to register for one as soon as possible.</li></ul>



<p>These elements work together to handle the transaction from start to finish.</p>



<h2>The Type of Transactions Handled by a Payment Gateway</h2>



<p>Before looking at how a business can integrate an <a href="http://localhost:8080/international-payments-local-vs-digital-banking/#:~:text=growth%20in%20the-,international,-payments%20sector%20and">international payment solution</a> into its website, you should look into the types of transactions present. Your business type will influence the one youâ€™ll pick for use.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Its purpose is to determine whether a client can pay for the goods or services ordered. It will terminate the fund transfer if the card doesnâ€™t have enough funds.<br></li><li><strong>Refund:</strong> Several processes occur in the background. If a cancellation has to occur for any reason, the merchant has no option but to refund the funds deducted. Refunds only apply to Sale and Capture types of transactions.<br></li><li><strong>Capture:</strong> It enables the merchant to capture the funds that were previously authorized by the client and transmit them for settlement. It typically applies to products ordered online that took a long time to ship or manufacture.<br></li><li><strong>Void:</strong> Itâ€™s quite similar to refund transactions. However, they only apply when a given transaction hasnâ€™t been settled. It should disappear from a clientâ€™s card statement within twenty-four hours.<br></li><li><strong>Sale:</strong> Such transactions tend to combine captures and authorizations. You should only use it when a transaction gets fulfilled immediately. It works well for businesses selling services and can provide user access immediately after the transfer has occurred.</li></ul>



<h2>Types of Payment Gateways</h2>



<p>Now that you know what payment gateways are and their role in handling digital payments, itâ€™s time you learned about the available types. Take your time to understand what the market offers before settling on a particular type.</p>



<p>Presently, there are three <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-a-payment-gateway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">types of gateways</a>: hosted, non-hosted, and custom.</p>



<h3>1. Hosted Payment Gateways and Applicable Examples</h3>



<p>These gateways will redirect the client from the eCommerce portal to make a payment. Once done, they will transfer them back to your site to proceed with the checkout process.</p>



<p>Most business owners love them as they are easy to integrate and will usually handle all security aspects. The downside is that you wonâ€™t have control over the payment process, which means you might lose a client if they get distracted and opt to head elsewhere.</p>



<p>Today, the international payment systems examples of hosted gateways include:</p>



<ul><li>PayPal</li><li>Amazon Pay</li><li>Stripe</li><li>SagePay</li></ul>



<h3>2. Integrated/ Non-Hosted Payment Gateways and Applicable Examples</h3>



<p>If you donâ€™t want to lose control over the process, you may want to consider using payment processors that can smoothly integrate into your website. Such gateways will also keep the customer on your platform.</p>



<p>While smooth integration is their main selling point, thereâ€™s the issue of security. The merchant must handle fraud prevention, PCI compliance, and secure cardholder information storage.<br>International payment systems examples of non-hosted gateways include:</p>



<ul><li>Authorize.net</li><li>SagePay Direct Integration</li><li>MangoPay</li></ul>



<h3>3. Custom Payment Gateways for eCommerce Ventures</h3>



<p>While there exist many payment gateways, you may want to develop one from scratch. They provide various integration methods and a full shopping experience to their customers. Large companies, for example, are more likely to benefit from custom solutions.</p>



<p>Such solutions enable them to break away from any restrictions placed by the vendor.</p>



<h3>The Process of Building Custom Payment Processors/Gateways</h3>



<p>The creation process requires the merchant to complete a series of steps: the first is to register with a credit company through the bank you intend to use when acquiring the card.</p>



<ul><li>I. Contract banks that serve as payment processors to deal with the processing aspect.</li><li>II. Start developing an API, ensuring you provide strong documentation for it.</li><li>III. Develop a tokenization solution to serve as a fraud protection measure.</li><li>IV. Ensure the application becomes PCI DSS compliant.</li><li>V. Put in place additional payment channels, e.g., mobile wallets and bitcoin.</li><li>VI. Develop a web application to assist in administering merchant operations.</li></ul>



<p>Companies that donâ€™t want to develop from scratch can use open-source applications. Using open-sourced payment processors will significantly reduce engineering costs. However, it may restrict customization.</p>



<p>The benefits of a custom international payment solution include customization, low transaction fees, and the chance to offer the gateway as a product. Such solutions work well for large enterprises.</p>
