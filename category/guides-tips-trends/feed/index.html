					<description><![CDATA[People send money abroad for different reasons. But before you can initiate an EFT, there are a few things that you should know. Read on to learn more!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Individuals commonly send money abroad for different purposes, e.g., remitting money to family or paying employees in a different country. If youâ€™re an ex-pat, you may want to do this when buying a car or a house in your new country of residence.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/sending-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, you should know a few things before using banking as a service platform to remit money. These will include your rights, the information the platform should provide, and how to compare costs.</p>



<p>Apart from your rights, thereâ€™s a need to learn about the different platforms available and how each operates. Most importantly, you should know that remitting funds internationally depends on whether you want to value, security, speed, or a blend of all three.</p>



<h2>Send Money Abroad: 6 Things You Need to Know Before You Do </h2>



<h3>1. The Laws in The Country of Residence</h3>



<p>Sending funds abroad isnâ€™t a crime, but it may become one if you arenâ€™t careful. Organized crime syndicates have used <a href="http://localhost:8080/the-simple-guide-on-electronic-funds-transfers/#:~:text=economy%20relies%20on-,digital%20payments,-.%20This%20means%20that">digital payments</a> for money laundering purposes for years. The situation has forced local law enforcement to formulate laws to prevent such crimes.</p>



<p>Fraud, racketeering, and tax evasion are serious crimes that attract severe penalties. Failure to observe laws governing international money transfers can lead to your arrest. You can protect yourself from this by keeping abreast of all money transfer laws in your country.</p>



<p>For example, learn whether your country of residence has placed a cap on the amounts permissible for transmission without tax forms. Others may require you to file a report even when performing a one-time transaction.</p>



<h3>2. Available Money Transfer Options</h3>



<p>Banks were once the only option available to individuals looking to send money. Today, this is no longer the case, thanks to the emergence of cheaper and <a href="http://localhost:8080/send-money-abroad-the-best-options-out-there/#:~:text=Cheaper%20and%20flexible%20options">more flexible options</a>. Below is a look at some of these options:</p>



<p>â€¢ Verv: Individuals with Verv personal accounts can send money abroad to over 120 countries. It has some of the most competitive rates in the money transfers market while protecting your account with password-less biometric authentication.</p>



<p>â€¢ PayPal: The giant money transfer company easily beats its peers with its fast services. All you need to send funds is an account on the platform. The recipient will receive the funds instantly and transfer them to their bank account the next day.</p>



<p>â€¢ Wise: Formerly known as TransferWise, Wise has the best exchange rates in the industry. Its upfront fees are low and allow you to remit funds to over 70 countries. Same-day delivery services are available, while bank transfers may take a few days.</p>



<h3>3. Exchange Rates</h3>



<p>Before using <a href="http://localhost:8080/baas-explained-comparison-of-baas-service-providers/#:~:text=processing%20industry%20is-,banking%20as%20a%20service,-(BaaS)%20and%20the">banking as a service</a> platform to remit money, make sure you know the prevailing exchange rates. Every money transfer platform will provide a different exchange rate, making it necessary to compare what each offers.</p>



<p>Itâ€™s not uncommon to come across meagre exchange rates on some platforms. Platforms may offer low rates to enable them to profit from the transaction. Take your time to compare the rates on offer.</p>



<p>If youâ€™re unsure of what to do, visit their official websites and compare the rates listed with those on Google. Other comparison sites include XE and other platforms offering the same remittance service. Remember, the higher the rate, the money a recipient will receive.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research.jpg" alt="research how to send money abroad" class="wp-image-789" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/send-money-research-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>4. Service Charges on Offer</h3>



<p>Most money remittance companies claim to have the lowest fees in the market to attract more users. Banks apply the same approach when marketing their remittance services. However, you shouldnâ€™t let these marketing gimmicks fool you!</p>



<p>Digital payment companies, banks, and <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">payment gateways</a> arenâ€™t required by law to reveal what happens behind the scenes during the transfer process. The trick lies in knowing what questions to ask before you transact.</p>



<p>Determining the exchange rate the platform will use on your transaction can allow you to learn a few truths. For example, you should walk away from a platform that offers a low rate but doesnâ€™t charge any service fees.</p>



<p>Why You Need to Walk Away</p>



<p>You stand a better chance with a company that charges a fixed service charge per transaction. Such banking as a service platform will offer an exchange rate thatâ€™s either high for each dollar or reasonably close to the mid-market rates.</p>



<p>While at it, establish whether the amount you get after multiplying the amount sent with the exchange rate matches what the recipient will receive. If you learn that the platform will subtract a separate fee on the receiving end, this can reduce the amount received.</p>



<p>Experts refer to this technique as â€˜adding an under-serviced charge.</p>



<h3>5. Reputation and Security of the Banking as a Service Platform</h3>



<p>Security is always an issue when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dealing with EFTs</a>. While banks are traditionally secure, they arenâ€™t the first choice for sending money abroad. It would help if you looked into the security of every platform under consideration.</p>



<p>For example, focus on the website security of currency specialists and money transfer platforms before signing up. Check whether they have data protection measures, e.g., encryption standards, to protect the data from getting intercepted.</p>



<p>Inquire from family and friends on which options are the best. While at it, confirm that your bank details wonâ€™t get revealed or sold to third parties. Check the address bar to confirm that it starts with HTTPS or has a green lock button before the URL.</p>



<h3>6. The Transfer Speed</h3>



<p>Just because you want to send money to another country doesnâ€™t mean it should take long to reach the recipient. Apart from security and the exchange rate, the speed at which the recipient will receive the money also matters.</p>



<p>A speedy transfer is necessary as an emergency might occur at any moment. Confirm with the service provider the number of hours or days it will take for the recipient to receive the money.</p>



<p>Please note that some platforms provide a higher rate for speedy transfers. Others may charge higher transaction costs for the same service. Choose a platform that wonâ€™t take too long to deliver the funds where theyâ€™re needed.</p>



<h2>Risks When Sending Money Abroad</h2>



<p>Now that you know what you need to know before sending money abroad, itâ€™s time to look at the potential risks of such a transaction. The options listed earlier are safe and secure, but international transactions arenâ€™t without risks. Such risks can include:</p>



<p>â€¢ Exchange Rates: Most money remittance platforms will lock in a rate once they have sent you a quote. If possible, try to remit the funds using the recipientâ€™s currency. Where this is impossible, take your time to understand all the applicable fees.</p>



<p>â€¢ Delays: Delays are common even when dealing with established and reputable companies. Although they can occur for several reasons, the company should have a compensation policy in place in case of delays.</p>



<p>â€¢ Applicable Limits: Research the transaction limits put in place by each platform. Some are best for large transfers, while others will charge you favourably for smaller transactions. Research in advance to avoid getting disappointed at the last minute.</p>



<h2>Details Needed to Send Money Abroad</h2>



<p>Regardless of the method or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/sending-money-to-family-and-friends-fast/#:~:text=You%20only%20need%20the%20receiver&#039;s,to%20check%20before%20sending%20money." target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform</a>, you want to use to send money, youâ€™ll need to have specific details with you. These will include:</p>



<p>â€¢ Address and name of the recipientâ€™s bank</p>



<p>â€¢ Full name and address of the receiver</p>



<p>â€¢ The International Bank Account Number</p>



<p>â€¢ The BIC/SWIFT code of the receiving bank</p>



<p>â€¢ Reason for sending the funds, e.g., work expenses, medical funds, etc.</p>



<p>As you can see, there are a lot of details you need to know before you can use banking as a service platform to remit funds. Though the process may appear complex, knowing whatâ€™s expected of you can make it faster, secure, and cheaper.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A business bank account enables payment processing to or from your entityâ€™s employees and clients, process at reasonable rates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>About eighty per cent of businesses have different bank accounts for personal and business purposes. A separate account will enable your entity to organize its accounting records, avoid overspending, and accurately file taxes.</p>



<p>Ideally, you may opt to open a general checking or savings, payroll, or business tax account integrated or linked to your employees or clients. Despite all these, there are standard procedures to be followed when youâ€™re seeking accounts that incorporate such services.</p>



<p>Key steps of opening an account include making your choice and approaching the bank, plus preparing the required documents. You can open employee or client accounts online or in person, after which youâ€™ll verify that the set-up is in order. In this article, letâ€™s explore how to easily open an account for your employees, clients or business.</p>



<h2>Whatâ€™s Needed When Opening a Bank Account for Your Business, Clients or Employees?</h2>



<p>Initially, youâ€™ll have to find a bank that meets your businesses, clients, and employeesâ€™ needs before identifying the features needed in such accounts. For example, you may require <a href="http://localhost:8080/better-business-bank-account-integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specific features</a> like cash management, deposit reconciliation, or mobile check deposit services.</p>



<p>Proper documentation is essential when opening your business account because the required materials are dependent on your corporate structure. By principle, a taxpayer identification number is needed when opening accounts for employees or clients. That can be in the form of social security or employee identification number.</p>



<p>When youâ€™re into a partnership or cooperation, you must have an Employee Identification Number EIN. According to the Small Business Administration, SBA, the documents below are what you need relative to your enterpriseâ€™s structure. These include;</p>



<ul><li>Sole Proprietorship- Youâ€™ll need your social security number or employee identification numbers. Also required are your business license or name filing documents.</li><li>Partnership- Be prepared with your employeeâ€™s identification number and partnership agreement. Alternatively, the bank may ask for your business name filing documents.</li><li>Corporations- Corporations require their employeeâ€™s identification numbers to easily open an account alongside their articles of incorporation.</li><li>Limited Liability Companies- LLCs require the social security number or identification number of their clients or employees, alongside the companyâ€™s articles of organization, to open accounts.</li></ul>



<p>Youâ€™ll have to ensure that all these requirements are intact, and you may bring other documents to indicate your cash-flow projections. Opening a bank account online or in-person depends on which industry your business belongs to. That may include sectors like government, telemarketing, gambling, or precious metal and mining operations.</p>



<p>In contrast, the rest of the other accounts may depend on your preference. You may follow the process in person or use many of the <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online portals</a> of fintech banks. Your success in opening a bank account is determined by your verification process.</p>



<p>If you opened a business checking account, youâ€™d have to be sure that the names on the check match your enterpriseâ€™s legal name. Ensure that your deposits go through so that you can track your incoming and outgoing funds for the proper order of the business.</p>



<h2>How Easy Is It to Open Bank Accounts On Behalf Of Your Employees, Clients or Business?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-easy-it-is-to-open-an-account-for-your-team-640x427-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-881" width="478" height="319" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-easy-it-is-to-open-an-account-for-your-team-640x427-1.jpg 640w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/how-easy-it-is-to-open-an-account-for-your-team-640x427-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></figure>



<p>For financial security and accountability, youâ€™ve to open a bank account to aid the progress of your business growth. Itâ€™s also mandatory for companies with separate legal entities to open such an account. Employee or client accounts also alleviate tracking incomes and expenses, especially for mixed funds, usually tricky.</p>



<p>Therefore, you can use your personal statement to create recognition for your businessâ€™s bank account. Youâ€™ll use business statements of reconciliation to relate your accounting books so that your financial service provider gets a view of your finances without moving funds.</p>



<p>If you notice uncalled tax deductions, youâ€™ll have to refer to your records to legitimize your claim. Thereâ€™s a need to separate personal funds from <a href="https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/how-to-open-business-bank-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business finances</a>, which helps you determine the performance of your enterprise. It also helps you create an accurate budget and a project cash flow.</p>



<p>It would be best to avoid the risk of mixing personal and business funds, as it may prove challenging to differentiate between the two. That could also necessitate an Internal Revenue Service or IRS audit.</p>



<h2>What Are the Benefits of Opening a Business-Oriented Bank Account?</h2>



<p>When you open a bank account, it helps you build a professional and beneficial relationship with the financial service provider of your choice. Small business owners are flexible as it enables them to allocate credit cards to their employees and receive loans for significant company expenses.

<p>Opening a business account from the same bank, you opened your personal account may call for relatively low fees and benefits.</p>



<h3>Lower Banking Fees and Rates</h3>



<p>Since fees and rates vary from different banks, youâ€™re advised to consider interest rates for lines of credit, overdrafts, and checking and savings accounts.

Youâ€™ll also realize business cost reductions when you utilize All-in-one work tools like a <a href="http://localhost:8080/business-internet-banking-building-your-own-app/">mobile app</a>.</p>



<p>That offers features that make payrolls and other banking activities easier.<br>Thereâ€™s a benefit of time-track compliances if you digitize your system, which may save time and money on accounting fees.</p>



<p>That makes your workflow more streamlined, but your business appears professional.<br>Arguably, during the growth of a business, adding an element of technology is vital as it complements the opening of a business bank account. It ensures payroll efficiency and avoids financial wastage in your entityâ€™s administration.</p>



<h3>Whatâ€™s the Suitable Account for Your Business?</h3>

<h2>Business Checking Accounts for Clients and Employees</h2>

A debit card and a chequebook are also included, making transactions easy, and it aids <a href="http://localhost:8080/5-ways-to-finance-your-business-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online and mobile banking</a>.</p>

Notably, you should be aware that Federal law restricts you to six free-fee withdrawals per month. Most accounts donâ€™t permit you to write checks or draw cash using ATMs.</p>



<p>However, as much as they provide an opportunity to accrue interest on your money, BSAs come with high opening deposits and limited access to funds.</p>



<h3>Business Certificates of Deposit Accounts CD</h3>



<p>With CD accounts, your business may realize more interests, and you cannot access your money for a certain period. You could encounter penalties if you donâ€™t comply with these terms.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is your banking as a service platform meeting your customer expectations? Read on to learn how to improve your online banking experience with five tips. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>These tips will come in very handy to you because as you might already know, most banks and credit unions in America and worldwide have already launched digital banking platforms for their clients. But is banking as a service platform satisfying your client&#8217;s needs? Learning what your clients expect can make it easier to offer a better banking experience.</p>



<p>Many successful businesses in the <a href="http://localhost:8080/introduction-to-banking-on-the-internet/#:~:text=common%20knowledge%20that-,banking,-is%20a%20crucial">banking industry</a> understand the importance of providing their clients with a custom smartphone app. Such an app enables the customers to gain direct access to the bank&#8217;s digital experience, eCommerce store, and official website.</p>



<p>Banks need such services to provide on-the-go solutions to their clients. However, a custom app isn&#8217;t everything. Clients expect the facilities they are dealing with to anticipate their needs and create a strategy to guarantee them access to the best services possible.</p>



<h2>5 Tips to Use in Improving Your Banking as A Service Experience</h2>



<p>Implementing the proper techniques in a banking facility can significantly impact customer experience. Better customer experience will enable you to increase the <a href="http://localhost:8080/online-banking-made-easier-with-online-banking/#:~:text=growth%20of%20the-,internet%20banking,-sector%20does%20not">adoption of internet banking</a>, thereby reducing the stress placed on other banking facilities.</p>



<h3>Tip 1. Implement Advanced Financial Technology</h3>



<p>Businesses operating in the financial sector have to balance meeting customer demands and remaining compliant with existing laws and regulations. Though it seems like a tricky balancing act, it&#8217;s doable, especially when you add technology into the equation.</p>



<p>Deploying the latest financial technology in your business will enable you to strike this balance. Customers will get a streamlined way to perform their banking, and the efficiency of your customer support team will become significantly enhanced.</p>



<p>Combining the two leads to better revenue generation and significantly enhanced customer satisfaction. When using financial technology to boost efficiency and customer fulfilment, you should consider:</p>



<ul><li>Using biometrics, e.g., fingerprint, voice, and eye scanning to boost security</li><li>Relying on social media to enhance marketing. Use it to target clients in different locations.</li><li>Deploying a more sophisticated <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">platform for mobile payments</a></li><li>Using the latest video technology to customize the customer&#8217;s online banking experience</li></ul>



<h3>Tip 2. Use Reduced Customer Input and Streamlined Navigation to Minimize Effort</h3>



<p>An ideal mobile banking platform should incorporate instant redirects and proper navigation. The two will come in handy in pointing the banking customer to the information, resources, or services they need to use.</p>



<p>During the design phase, consider incorporating icons and landmarks, e.g.,</p>



<ul><li>Labels</li><li>Section navigation tools</li><li>Search boxes in the banking platform</li></ul>



<p>Their addition will make a sophisticated platform appear intuitive and straightforward. The design team can use touch heat maps to identify problem areas in the navigation before releasing newer versions.</p>



<p>Customers want to use an app or platform that doesn&#8217;t require too much information or effort from them. For example, consider setting up defaults or automatically populating data for repetitive actions.</p>



<p>Enabling predictive text, spell-check, and auto-suggestion can reduce customer errors and effort. Just make sure that you don&#8217;t overdo it, as this may turn some clients away. If done correctly, it will reduce the time spent inputting client data.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people.jpg" alt="Tip number 3, artificial intelligence vs people" class="wp-image-805" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tip-3-artificial-intelligence-people-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>Tip 3. Consider Having an AI and Real Person Option</h3>



<p>More and more banking as a service platform are including automated AI assistants to help their clients navigate their experiences efficiently. Depending on the website setup, the designers may choose to go with either of two options:</p>



<ol><li>A Chatbot: The chatbot will pop up immediately a user accesses the website to ask what they need and whether they need any help.</li><li>Pop-up Message: If a chatbot isn&#8217;t present, the platform can include a pop-up message, e.g., &#8220;How can I help you?&#8221;</li></ol>



<p>Both AI versions will work for the platform and guide the user to the services they need.</p>



<p>The Real Person Option</p>



<p>While AI options have become commonplace in most banking platforms, some customers believe banking systems have become too automated. Although these automated options can guide them to where they need to go, some clients want to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/06/15/want-to-build-your-brands-reputation-try-enhancing-the-customer-support-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk to real people.</a></p>



<p>The real person option helps when the customer request appears complicated for the AI to understand. Ensure that the platform has a one-call option to connect the client to a customer service rep over the phone.</p>



<p>Clients using desktop versions may want access to a chat button. They should get connected to a real person on the other end on activating the chat feature. This way, they will get a chance to explain in detail what they need from the agent.</p>



<h3>Tip 4. Use Explainer Videos to Simplify Financial Concepts</h3>



<p>The average human has a short attention span and will frown at the thought of having to read through a lengthy paragraph. And those who do read them may fail to grasp most of the financial terms used on your banking as a service platform.</p>



<p>Studies show that up to <a href="https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% of website visitors</a> will leave a platform within the first 15 seconds. The best way to avoid this is by using short videos on your platform. Such videos should feature feel-good background music, easy-to-understand scripts, and attractive graphics.</p>



<p>Use these videos to explain any financial concepts that regular people may have a hard time understanding. Additional ways to attract engagement and provide a positive banking experience include:</p>



<ul><li>Using YouTube tutorials to explain how the entire platform works</li><li>Influencer posts to inform your clients of new and upcoming services</li><li>Explainer videos on terms that may prove complex for non-techie clients</li></ul>



<h3>Tip 5. Empower Your People and Personalize Training</h3>



<p>Build advocacy and create awareness among your frontline personnel before introducing new features to your banking as a service platform. Train them, engage them, and let them participate in the pilot programs.</p>



<p>Ensure that your personnel understands the benefits that will arise from introducing these features. It&#8217;s impossible for staff to confidently promote a platform or the new features it promises when they don&#8217;t know how it can benefit their clients.</p>



<p>As you engage in the training sessions, collect feedback from them, and use the questions they raise to create a comprehensive list of FAQs. Select the &#8216;product champions&#8217; to spearhead the promotion exercises from the information collected.</p>



<p>Why You Need to Prioritize Employee Training</p>



<p>The amount of time, effort, and resources assigned to employee training can impact the customer&#8217;s overall banking experience. Your employees need to understand how the system works before offering any help to clients who encounter issues when using it.</p>



<p>If using an in-house solution, have the team conduct training sessions to teach your people what to expect, how the platform works, and how it will benefit the clients. You should only roll it out after your support team has understood its inner workings.</p>



<p>Companies using solutions sourced from third parties should request training manuals. Use these to train your people and guide them on how the banking as a service platform works, its features, and why they should actively promote it to your clients.</p>



<h2>The Takeaway from these Five Tips</h2>



<p>The reality is that every banking facility will have a broad customer base. From the five tips explained above, some will work better for some facilities than others. As such, there&#8217;s a need to assess the platform&#8217;s performance regularly.</p>



<p>Apart from providing access to client accounts, you should use the digital experience to market all your upcoming products and services. If the facility has recently started to offer auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, or private loans, make sure to display this on the platform.</p>



<p>Offering the best banking as a service experience involves ensuring clients have a chance to customize their experience. Allow them to choose what they would like to access and focus on showcasing what your facility can offer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Securing funding is by far the most challenging part of financing any banking as a service business. Read on for tips on where to find finance for your company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Online businesses, especially banking as a service startup, will typically face numerous challenges when trying to finance their operations. For <a href="http://localhost:8080/business-opportunies-with-banking-as-a-service-baas/#:~:text=The%20relationship%20that-,businesses,-have%20with%20their">businesses</a> that manage to get financing, the repayment terms and length aren&#8217;t generally ideal for them.</p>



<p>You only need to look at the financing conditions to understand the rigidity linked to legacy banking systems. FinTech companies today face several challenges when it comes to funding. These challenges place them at an increased risk of going under.</p>



<p>Studies show that lack of funding is the main reason 90% of startups fail within the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/#6fa5c1e26679" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first four years</a>. And even when digital payment companies are able to overcome this initial hurdle, they still need to find alternative financing options to expand.</p>



<h2>Determining the Type of Banking as a Service Funding You Need</h2>



<p>There are several factors to consider when you realize that you need external funding. They include:</p>



<ul><li>Your industry: Healthcare companies, financial companies, and FinTech firms typically offer the best returns on investment. They are, therefore, an attractive equity financing option for most investors.</li><li>Your existing network: The question here is one, &#8220;which circles are you associated with?&#8221; If you know many people, the better your chances of meeting people who can assist you in finding investors.</li><li>The amount of money needed: <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">Digital payment</a> startups should concentrate on equity financing. Such companies require vast amounts for office space, development, and talent. Consider debt financing if the company is already operational.</li><li>How soon you need the money: Consider internet debt financing if you don&#8217;t have much time. Alternative lenders can make the funds available in as little as twenty-four to forty-eight hours.</li><li>What ownership percentage do you want to retain? Working with part-owner investors may limit your decision-making capability, making it harder to achieve your goals.</li></ul>



<h2>5 Ways to Finance Your Banking as a Service Business</h2>



<h3>1. Friends, Relatives, and Angel Investors</h3>



<p>Apart from personal savings, friends, relatives, and angel investors often act as the primary go-to option for anyone looking to start a business. But for this method to work, the people you&#8217;re approaching must trust you and believe you&#8217;re a reliable person.</p>



<p>Asking for financing from people in your life can prove scary for any person. Money has the potential to ruin relationships if a person isn&#8217;t careful. Make sure to set repayment timelines for the people you approach.</p>



<p>Alternatively, consider offering them a percentage of the revenue you&#8217;ll receive from the business within the first few years. You shouldn&#8217;t let your poor investment decisions ruin long-term friendships. Always communicate clearly on how you intend to use this money.</p>



<h3>2. Credit Cards and Lines of Credit</h3>



<p>Credit cards and personal lines of credit serve as a good financing option for companies that would like to charge expenses now and pay the debt later. And this is not forgetting that such cards can pay you back in the form of cash backs, miles, or points.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s not recommended to use credit cards to finance your <a href="http://localhost:8080/banking-as-a-service-progress-continues-as-banking-is-made-less-difficult/#:~:text=is%20because%20of-,banking%20as%20a%20service,-(BaaS)%20that%20there">banking as a service startup</a> if you can&#8217;t differentiate between them. You may not know this, but there exists a major difference between individual and business credit cards.</p>



<p>Using a personal credit card to finance your operations may prove messy when the time comes to file your annual business returns. Ensure that you use the personal credit card for personal expenses and vice versa.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll also want to read the fine print for the credit card. Pay specific attention to:</p>



<ul><li>Card benefits, e.g., shopping protections and premium travel benefits</li><li>Introductory and regular APRs for balance transfers and purchases</li><li>Rewards program</li><li>Annual fees</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-banking-as-a-service.jpg" alt="business banking as a service" class="wp-image-784" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-banking-as-a-service.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-banking-as-a-service-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-banking-as-a-service-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>3. Banking as a Service Financing from Venture Capitalists</h3>



<p>Before going any further, you should note that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/12/10/whats-driving-the-rise-in-venture-capital-style-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">venture capital</a> financing doesn&#8217;t apply to all entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists are mainly interested in tech-driven companies and companies with high growth potential.</p>



<p>VCs will primarily focus on funding companies in biotechnology, information technology, and digital payments. When funding your startup, the venture capitalists will want to take an equity position in the firm.</p>



<p>They will take up this position to aid the coming execute a promising but risky project. You&#8217;ll need to give up a stake in your company to get funding. Most venture capitalists earn a return on their investment when the business begins selling shares to the general public.</p>



<p>Luckily, they possess knowledge and experience which will help your business operations.</p>



<h3>4. Strategic or Private Partnerships with Other Brands</h3>



<p>Entering into a strategic partnership with another company can provide your <a href="http://localhost:8080/what-does-a-banking-as-a-service-provider-do/#:~:text=as%20a%20service%20(-,BaaS,-)%20frequently%20in%20the">banking as a service</a> platform with access to new goods and services. Increased access to innovative products and new markets can make it easier to increase customer loyalty.</p>



<p>They can also enable you to overtake your more established competitors. The challenge lies in identifying your clients&#8217; pain points and finding a partner that can help you meet them. Any agreement you sign should benefit both companies equally.</p>



<p>Let your business purpose determine the partnerships you form. As such, before forming a partnership, you should consider:</p>



<ul><li>The customer profiles shared by the businesses</li><li>Determine whether the companies share the same values?</li><li>Inquire from the other brand on how they intend to benefit from the partnership</li><li>Do the goods and services offered by both companies complement each other?</li></ul>



<h3>5. Peer to Peer Lending (P2P)</h3>



<p>Peer-to-peer loans allow startups and established businesses to seek funding from investors using specialized online borrowing platforms. Applications are speedy, with decisions on loans being communicated within a few minutes.</p>



<p>If your funding request gets approved, the money gets disbursed faster than it would have if you had borrowed from a bank. The terms associated with P2P lending are typically more flexible, and the length can vary from a month to five years.</p>



<p>The downside to these loans is the typically fixed repayments, which can significantly impact internet businesses. Although the APR for peer-to-peer lending is low, startups may have difficulty securing funding.</p>



<p>Before funding, some investors will need to know how much a business makes per year.</p>



<h2>Why Startups Have a Hard Time Getting Financing from Banks</h2>



<p>Small businesses and startups have a hard time accessing capital for several reasons. Many assume it&#8217;s because banks have stringent requirements, but this is not all. Traditional banks employ labour-intensive regulations and lending processes.</p>



<p>These processes are often unfavourable to small organizations which require quick funding to remain afloat. Another factor is that most small businesses are merely starting and don&#8217;t have extensive profit and loss statements to show to the banks to prove profitability.</p>



<h3>Advantages Offered by Alternative Lending to Banking as a Service Businesses</h3>



<p>Small businesses can benefit in several ways by considering alternative lending in place of traditional banks. Borrowing from non-traditional sources, such as those mentioned above, lets you enjoy access to a robust and highly invested partner(s).</p>



<p>These partners have connections to the media, industry analysts, other contacts, and even new clients. By opting for alternate lending, you get to enjoy benefits such as:</p>



<ul><li>Relatively hands-off partnership: They will leave you to manage the day-to-day operations and only come in when there are major decisions you need to make.</li><li>Market credibility: Your market gets to benefit from the goodwill that the partner has already built for their business. Partnering with a strong brand will lend weight to your business.</li><li>Overall business guidance: Their investment in your company may involve joining its board of directors. From here, they will offer invaluable viewpoints and advice that will help the business grow and expand operations.</li></ul>



<p>Every banking-as-a-service business requires capital to operate. The five tips provided above can help the company get the money it needs to continue operating.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Choosing to integrate your enterprise bank account with extra resources gives you visibility and control over your business finances.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To best run your company, itâ€™s essential to streamline your finances and accounting. But what happens when youâ€™re relying on multiple platforms of financial management? When integrating comes in handy, you have to learn how to build better business bank account integrations.</p>



<p>You can leverage robust solutions offered by business banking to give your customers a dynamic, convenient experience. These include but arenâ€™t limited to accounting, expense tracking, invoicing, notification, and syncing. With <a href="http://localhost:8080/internet-bank-vs-traditional-bank-which-is-more-secure/">finance-based security integrations</a> on your business bank account, you can also protect buyersâ€™ data from cyber-attacks.</p>



<p>Besides your bank account, you need additional tools such as integrations with payment methods that help run your enterprise. Digital banks and banking as-a-service providers understand this the most, taking on approaches that integrate everything. Read further to learn how better to build your businessâ€™s finances with integrated resources.</p>



<h2>Whatâ€™s the Benefit of Business Bank Account Integrations?</h2>



<p>Your business is yours, and nobody knows it better than you, and that means you understand your customerâ€™s needs. Choosing the right business banking can be challenging, made more so by the propensity of retail banks to make finer details even more opaque than is necessary. Thatâ€™s because they have vested financial interests, keeping you reliant on their feature packages than breaking free with account integrations.</p>



<p>To better care for your customers, identify the services and features you need to incorporate into your business account. Examine integral products through the eyes of your companyâ€™s goals to avoid over-integration, which can stunt your ability for growth.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://localhost:8080/business-banking-and-the-internet-today/">rise of digital banks</a> has provided resources that show banking shouldnâ€™t be separate from payroll, expense management, invoicing, and other crucial business processes. Banking-as-a-service providers incorporate these services into their products to save their consumers time and money. That means you can build your business account using integrations to have everything in one place.</p>



<h2>Enterprise Bank Account Integrations Guarantee Ease of Accounting and Security of Audit Trails</h2>



<p>With your current business account, you can probably access such processes as invoicing or expense management. But these come with additional charges for payroll, access to credit and so forth. Your situation warrants a paid-for plan, which bundles together these services while bringing the cost down.</p>



<p>If you pay for administration software, digital bank, or fintech solutions, they will provide your firm with advanced integrations. That means you can save time that you manually gave to inputting data, relocating that to your company management. For instance, you can build bank account integrations that link your accounting software.</p>



<p>With the correct bank account integrations, you can seamlessly integrate the most popular of these, which are;</p>



<ul><li>QuickBooks</li><li>Mint</li><li>Quicken</li><li>FreshBooks</li><li>Wave</li><li>Xero</li><li>Gusto</li><li>Expensify</li></ul>



<p>Such financial solutions are at hand hassle-free, with automatic payment fees and a wealth of accounting options to choose from. With such integration, you can ensure greater banking transaction accuracy, including processed account reconciliation and automated risk management. Youâ€™ll be expediting critical payments, will approve and carry out other transaction activities autonomously or at the click of a button.</p>



<h2>Should You Choose Banking as a Service Instead of Integrating Traditional Business Bank Account?</h2>



<p>Your business bank account separates your enterprise from your other finances in the least complex sense. If your business is a legal entity with limited companies, then having a specialized trade account is required. But even for smallholders or sole proprietors, such accounts assist in keeping cleaner records and ease the submission of self-assessment.</p>



<p>In the banking space, <a href="https://startups.co.uk/banking/best-challenger-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenger banks</a> or digital and mobile-first entities establish or build bank account integrations for your business more than traditional institutions. Fintech and neo bank operators are characterized by their shared mission to make banking user-controllable and transparent. As portrayed by banking-as-a-service provisions, such features put back the power in your customerâ€™s hands.</p>



<p>Their generalized use of the internet or mobile apps provides unequalled access to your business bank account and its integrations. In the UK, the approval and regulation of these digital banks are overseen by the FCA or Financial Conduct Authority. You can also rest easy since they should also carry insurance protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, FSCS, for the loss of the first Â£85,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-account-features.jpg" alt="business banking features" class="wp-image-777" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-account-features.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-account-features-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/business-account-features-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h2>What Features Should You Expect in an Integrated Business Bank Account?</h2>



<p>A well-built business bank account does more than handle your money and transactions but instead goes the extra mile. Using integrations helps ease administrative burdens while assisting your customers in managing their expenses. Many integration providers add flexible lending services that facilitate cash flow or investment hurdles for the short or long term. Itâ€™s up to you to set up the best services while keeping an eye on any hidden charges.</p>



<p>Besides the accounting integrations I spoke about earlier, features that build better business bank accounts include;</p>



<h3>Additional Cards or Extra Pay-Way Options</h3>



<p>You can have more credit cards or <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift.">digital payment gateways</a> like wallets for your employees to use, all linked to your business account. For this, youâ€™ll have a centralized account management system to track expenditure, restrict transactions or add and block cards. These could also be multi-currency to cut back travel exchange mark-ups and other travel costs.</p>



<h3>Online or Phone SMS Bank Account Access</h3>



<p>As part of digital banksâ€™ functionality, web and SMS access are integrations required nowadays, even for personal banking. Thatâ€™s where your business account allows you to make fund transfers or pay bills using your desktop, mobile phone, or tablet. Choose accounts that offer services like text alerts or USSD cost-free, which saves on your transaction costs.</p>



<h3>Priority Care or Business Banking Support</h3>



<p>As your business grows, you donâ€™t have time to wait for typical banking protocols of customer care. Your bank account should have 24/7 support team availability, especially when youâ€™ve integrated extra <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/">resources and a management system</a>. Digital banks and entities offering banking as a service provide in-app chat functions where your queries are handled almost instantly.</p>



<h3>Instant Invoicing and Downloadable CSV Exports</h3>



<p>Digital banking apps offer your business account simplicity when record keeping or tax reporting. Itâ€™s easier, with proper integration, to download and share CSV statements straight from your bank to your tax accountant. Besides generating tailored reports and data exportation, you can also track payments and match them with outstanding invoices.</p>



<h3>Offers of Flexible but Sustainable Business Credit</h3>



<p>If your business bank account provider doesnâ€™t have credit facilities that suit your enterprise, they should partner with lenders using seamless integrations. Some offer borrowing against overdrafts as part of extra flexibility or advances to give your enterprise a leg up during cash flow situations. Apart from loans, youâ€™ll also have access to exclusive perks and discounts that help get business up and running.</p>



<p>Your business might not require such an extent to build bank account integrations, and itâ€™s up to you to decide what to keep and what to do away with. Avoid an approach to â€˜integrate everything,â€™ seeing as you <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/uk/business-bank-accounts/7-tips-to-make-the-most-of-your-business-bank-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must keep maintenance fees</a> to the minimum. It may be more profitable to find another financial provider with bundled plans that suit your enterprise and its customersâ€™ requirements.</p>



<h2>Cutting Edge Digital Banking Help Make Business Bank Account Integration Hassle-Free</h2>



<p>Business bank account integrations make it easier for you to manage credit and debits, balances, statements, and other account reconciliations. You can have in-built or third-party services that assist with transaction recording, expense management, accounting, reporting, and cloud data storage. Integrating your enterpriseâ€™s finances may prove cheaper, more accurate, fast, and guarantee security, thus giving you more control.</p>

		<title>Easy Steps to Changing Banks: Making it Painless</title>

					<description><![CDATA[You donâ€™t need to be concerned about paperwork when changing banks, as financial providers have an agreement to make the process quick and painless.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many reasons can have you looking to change bank accounts. It could be better service, lower fees, digital payments, or youâ€™re seeking one with branches in more convenient locations. But are there easy steps to changing banks?</p>



<p>Switching banks may initially appear overwhelming and intimidating, and there are sacrifices and hard decisions to make. If youâ€™re considering other banking options and donâ€™t know how to make this leap, hereâ€™s a guide to show you how to make a quick and painless switch.</p>



<p>There are multiple causes of switching bank accounts, but the process is not as simple as tapping on a button. Itâ€™s an intentional decision to change banks but one that has the potential of many things going wrong. Keep reading to learn the steps to take when making a painless banking institution switch.</p>



<h2>Are There Legitimate Reasons to Change My Bank to another One?</h2>



<p>Maybe you think that you deserve better customer service or more access to innovative technological banking tools. It could be that youâ€™re tired of high transaction fees and want to be given more <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">options on financial products</a>. Your old bank may be outside the region you now preside in, and you yearn for branches and cash point machines in your location.</p>



<p>Some folks get married and want to combine accounts in another bank. Changing banks is within your consumer rights, and thereâ€™s no law against it as long as itâ€™s your personal finances. If youâ€™re not happy with how a bankâ€™s managing your money or their digital payments, itâ€™s better to find another service provider. Your new banking institution may even be offering rewards for switching, including cash or retail vouchers.</p>



<p>If youâ€™ve been with your old bank for some time, itâ€™s best to shop around and see whatâ€™s new in the retail banking sector. Youâ€™ll consider your needs while finding incentives to make the switch, such as interest perks, cash backs, or reward deals.</p>



<p>When changing banks, youâ€™ll see how different providers measure up to the obligations or expectations of your financial service during your account search. Youâ€™ll ask to review their overdraft and interest rates, standout features of their accounts, and credit eligibility criteria.</p>



<h2>How Do You Change Banks Quickly and Painlessly?</h2>



<p>Moving your money and other financial obligations is no mean task. Youâ€™ll have little peace of mind until you know that you wonâ€™t miss direct debits, and cheques wonâ€™t bounce. Will other platforms where your current account is linked, like PayPal, become affected and will card payments be on time?</p>



<p>If you break down this process, handling switching financial providers in manageable parts, changing banks is doable. As long as you donâ€™t let uncertainty stop you, itâ€™s easy to make a quick and painless switch to an institution that meets your needs. It doesnâ€™t make sense to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-to-switch-banks-a-step-by-step-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continue in unrewarded loyalty</a> while youâ€™re missing out on lower interest rates or fewer transaction fees.</p>



<p>Initially, youâ€™ll make a list of all the automatic digital payments, subscriptions, and recurring debits youâ€™ve set up in your present account. That eliminates the chance of bills, cards, or other digital payments getting mixed up during the switch. If youâ€™re using a fintech or Neo Bank, you can print out all your digital transactions for the month or quarter.</p>



<p>To initiate a process of changing banks, thatâ€™s quick and painless switch</p>



<h3>Choose a New Bank for Switching Accounts To</h3>



<p>Selecting a new financial provider is the most significant of the steps towards changing banks. A lousy fit could mean that you have to start the process all over again. You have multiple reasons for leaving your current bank, considered as qualities to check against with a new institution. The top priorities to pay attention to include;</p>



<ul><li>Account opening and balance requirements</li><li>Transactional fees</li><li>Ease and convenience of online banking</li><li>Interest rate variables on your account balance</li><li>Branch locations</li><li>Cash vending machine fees and locations</li><li>Customer service</li></ul>



<p>Other factors youâ€™ll look at in a new bank include how they ensure your money and their performance track record. Make use of the many available switch kits online that help to match the best institution to your lifestyle and income levels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/changing-banks-open-account.jpg" alt="changing banks and opening accounts" class="wp-image-769" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/changing-banks-open-account.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/changing-banks-open-account-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/changing-banks-open-account-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h3>Open a New Account at another Bank</h3>



<p>The sooner you open a new account in your preferred bank, the smoother and painless your switch. Opening an account takes less than 10 minutes, especially if youâ€™re doing it online. Youâ€™ll fill out a form with your name, address, employment details, and contact information. Some banks require photo identification, and your driving license or passport will suffice.</p>



<p>Youâ€™ll also make an initial deposit in your new account before youâ€™re issued new information and a debit or credit card. Instead of withdrawing all your funds from the old bank, leave in at least a monthâ€™s bills worth of cash. That covers any <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-painlessly-switch-banks-1537247659" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automatic payment processors</a> you may have missed to avoid lateness penalties.</p>



<p>Next, your new bank should follow up with the former institution for a statement of transactions for the last six to 13 months. That may include subscriptions or recurring fees for cloud software, streaming, rideshare, or public transport. Itâ€™ll also make switches for direct credits like salary, share dividends, and welfare or pension payments.</p>



<p>Your new bank will request the account and routing numbers from the institutions youâ€™re currently with for online account opening. Thatâ€™s used to verify deposit information from linked accounts before transferring funds. You can use this electronic link for transferring money and savings from your old banking institution.</p>



<h3>Close Your Old Account to Change Banks</h3>



<p>Once you are satisfied that all transactions have transferred to your new account, you can proceed to close the old one at your former bank. As the final step in your switch, closing accounts can be done online or in-person over the phone. Some banks charge fees for this, especially if youâ€™ve closed it within a specific time frame of its opening.</p>



<p>You can zero out any remaining balances by obtaining cash or a cashierâ€™s cheque. Your old bank might also be willing to transfer electronically to your new account. When you receive the final statement, read it carefully to ensure no deposits need transfer or other lingering payments.</p>



<p>Ask for written verification from your old bank that your account is closed. That comes in handy if they allow a debit transaction, which triggers non-payment fees. Other times, zombie accounts reappear, especially in online banking, and it makes sense to sign in regularly to check that it stays closed.</p>



<h3>Consider Mobile and Online Banking</h3>



<p>Now that your new account is set up, can you access it online or through mobile banking? Thatâ€™s typically your only option if youâ€™re new institution is an online-only fintech or a Neo Bank with dynamic portals.</p>



<p>Your bank will assist with opening your profiles for online and mobile banking. Youâ€™ll need to enrol or register into these portals before you can use your PIN, username, or password to log in and verify. That verification often involves <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2017/0207/Why-you-might-want-to-switch-your-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-factor authentication</a> using text or email. Downloading your new bankâ€™s mobile application guarantees a seamless account management experience.</p>



<h2>Find Enticing Offers to Open a New Account When Switching Banks</h2>



<p>The bank switching guarantee ensures that your new account is up and running within seven business days. That means all your digital payments and direct debits are transferred and new cheque books or cards issued.</p>



<p>Your new bank account is ideally from a top high street provider with various financial products as well as a high branch and cash point prevalence. You can find current basic accounts with no-frills for customers with poor credit who want stricter money management. Others come with benefits like higher-than-average savings interest or low borrowing rates for authorised overdrafts.</p>



<p>Banks now offer in-account packages like breakdown cover, travel insurance, or exclusive discounts. Instead of buying all these products separately, it works out cheaper as part of a money-saving incentive.</p>

<p>Whether you are rich or you are looking to get there, it is important to understand that there are so many possibilities and complications of going the offshore way. In some cases, the complexity of the tax regimes in countries like the US have led to the rich moving their <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-to-transfer-money-internationally/" data-type="post" data-id="478">money offshore.</a></p>



<p>According to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-03-american-banks-safe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies</a>, most American banks donâ€™t quite offer their customers safer and affordable banking solutions. The situation even gets worse in some parts of Europe because there are some insolvent banks that continuously put their customersâ€™ money at risk. This is just one of the things you need to know about offshore banking as a service (BaaS). You will learn more as you continue reading this comprehensive guide.</p>



<h2 id="is-offshore-banking-the-safer-alternative">Is offshore banking the safer alternative?</h2>



<p>Offshore online banking financial institutions are better alternatives to local banks because they are capable of giving their customers the peace of mind they need, knowing that their money is safe.</p>



<p>If you are a very wealthy individual with large chunks of money just sitting in the bank, it is only prudent that you have offshore bank accounts. Inasmuch as the process today isnâ€™t as straightforward as it used to be, opening these bank accounts is always worth the effort.</p>



<p>However, the bottom line is, there are a plethora of options when it comes to offshore banking. At the same time, there are numerous rules and regulations that you have to bear in mind before settling on a specific country you wish to open your account in.</p>



<h2 id="the-legal-aspect-of-offshore-banking">The legal aspect of offshore banking</h2>



<p>Before you open your offshore bank for online banking, you should steer clear of all the myths pointing to offshore BaaS as a front for illegal dealings. You shouldnâ€™t think of yourself as a villain looking to carry out some shady dealings.</p>



<p>The truth of the matter is, offshore bank accounts are fully legal. People just have to learn to shake off the misconception that these financial institutions exist to aid in money laundering or fronts to illegal or shady dealings.</p>



<p>Everyone has the right to <a href="https://www.escapeartist.com/offshore-banking-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open an offshore account</a> anytime they wish to, only that you have to ensure it is not a secret. Therefore, if you are thinking of opening an account for purposes of tax evasion, it then becomes illegal. Always ensure, whichever country youâ€™re from, you are complying with the laws of the land in regards to offshore BaaS.</p>



<p>It is important to take time to go through and understand the rules and regulations when it comes to offshore banking. When you have a comprehensive understanding of these financial systems work, you will start realising the immense opportunities available that will benefit you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1.jpg" alt="Digital Banking" class="wp-image-576" srcset="http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1.jpg 800w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1-300x150.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8080/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/how-baas-affects-the-consumer-1-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h2 id="why-you-should-consider-opening-an-offshore-bank-account">Why you should consider opening an offshore bank account</h2>



<p>Experienced financial advisors always warn against putting all your eggs in one basket, which loosely translates to avoiding putting all your wealth in one place. There are a host of reasons why you shouldnâ€™t do this and opt for banking offshore. They include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reducing political risk</strong>: Inasmuch the political systems in the western and European countries have been largely stable, it is only natural for someone with lots of money in the bank to feel anxious, especially with the war on the rich. Therefore, for the sake of peace of mind, go offshore. How federal and local governments have control over local bank accounts is not the same with offshore banking. The process of freezing or seizing foreign banking accounts is significantly harder. Always pick a politically stable country for sanityâ€™s sake.</li><li><strong>Asset protection</strong>: Because of national debts, governments wonâ€™t hesitate looking into peopleâ€™s personal accounts when push comes to shove. In some countries like Poland, Cyprus and Hungary, they have used peopleâ€™s personal assets to get out of sticky situations. In some cases, bureaucrats can just freeze your bank account any time they wish. Therefore, to avoid such hassles, it is only prudent to consider offshore banking.</li><li><strong>Deposit insurance fund insolvency</strong>: One fact that can be quite disturbing about the American FDIC has lower than 1% of deposits in their accounts. Therefore, if every<strong> bank in the US</strong> goes under, you will only receive about a $1 for every $300 deposit. To steer clear of such uncertainty, consider foreign banks because they offer deposit insurance, with some being unlimited. You can be sure that you money will stay protected in the occurrence of any unfortunate situation.</li><li><strong>Currency diversification</strong>: According to <a href="https://amzn.to/31aumny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Rickardâ€™s book</a>, the western countries are in currency wars, which calls for the need for people to diversify their currency. You can do this by buying gold and silver coins/bars and steer clear of intrusion from central bankers. You can also choose to go for currencies that local entities wouldnâ€™t bother with. You can choose popular offshore financial institution in countries like Singapore, Hong Kong or <strong>Andorra</strong> that work with multiple currencies and work with currencies gaining momentum.</li><li><strong>Better interest rates</strong>: After diversifying your currencies in foreign accounts, you can enjoy greater interest rates. For instance, some offshore bank accounts can offer up to 10 times greater interest rates than local banks. Furthermore, there are banks offering 11% APY as long as you donâ€™t withdraw money from your account for the stipulated duration.</li></ul>



<h2 id="what-you-need-to-open-an-offshore-bank-account">What you need to open an offshore bank account</h2>



<p>Different banks have different regulations, but in one way or another, the procedures for opening these bank accounts are pretty much the same. Some of the crucial documentation you will need to include:</p>



<ul><li>Copy of your passport</li><li>Filled-in application form</li><li>Proof of address â€“ utility bill</li><li>A letter from your bank showing your average balance and good standing</li><li>Proof of investment income</li><li>Some banks may ask your expected transaction sizes and transfer frequency</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>P.S</em></strong><em>: Some of these credentials needed may feel obtrusive but keep in mind that it is because of the jurisdictional pressure from governments around the world to curb funding terrorism, money laundering and tax evasion.</em></p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you want a legal way to protect your wealth from possibly unscrupulous governments or fundamentally unsound banking systems, consider moving a portion of your funds offshore online banking. This will ensure personal freedom while adding an extra layer of asset protection.</p>

<p>Many have been forced to try and call the institutions leading to heavy call volume.</p>



<p>Increased call volume in <a href="http://localhost:8080/banking-as-a-service-baas-explained/" data-type="post" data-id="470">internet banking companies</a> has led to longer hold times and untold frustration for the clients. So, what can they do to prevent a repeat of this in the future?</p>



<p>Online banking companies that were able to respond to urgent client needs at the pandemic&#8217;s peak have now gone into recovery mode.</p>



<p>They have started to incorporate new <strong>technologies and processes</strong> and are training their teams to adjust to the new normal. They are hopeful that this will help enhance their operations.</p>



<p>Below is a look at five ways to transform banking into a service.</p>



<h2 id="1-collect-client-experience-data-in-realtime-across-all-digital-payments-channels">1. Collect Client Experience Data in Realtime Across All Digital Payments Channels</h2>



<p>The first step banks need to take to transform banking, and the <a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift">digital payments</a> sector is to understand their customers&#8217; thinking.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a move that requires them to deploy surveys that can help them gather feedback across all their online banking channels.</p>



<p>Examples of how to do this include:</p>



<p>â€¢ Relationship feedback: A relationship survey allows a <a href="http://localhost:8080/baas-explained-comparison-of-baas-service-providers/" data-type="post" data-id="474">Baas </a>company to understand their clients&#8217; thoughts about their services. The input will shed light on whether client needs are being met.</p>



<p>â€¢ Mobile &amp; website feedback: Most customers interact with internet banking companies via a computer or mobile app. Ensuring they have a user-friendly system will ensure that they keep coming back.</p>



<p>â€¢ Customer support feedback: Missing a mortgage payment, filing a claim, or losing a <strong>credit/debit card </strong>are emotional experiences. You need to ensure that the company reps can take care of the company&#8217;s needs.</p>



<h3 id="2-identify-the-most-common-baas-requests">2. Identify the Most Common Baas Requests</h3>



<p>Identifying the common service requests will require determining which areas you can use to create a caring and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/11/12/adding-soul-for-a-great-customer-experience-in-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connected banking experience</a>.<br>Focus on common service requests such as:</p>



<p>â€¢ Ordering checks<br>â€¢ Reporting a lost credit card<br>â€¢ Frequent technical issues, e.g.,</p>



<p>o How to reset a digital payments systems password<br>o How to unlock an account</p>



<p>For example, your customers may be calling the bank because you don&#8217;t have other support alternatives, such as an online chatbot.</p>



<p>Such routine inquiries and processes are a great starting point, especially when introducing automation. They will help in transforming your banking services.</p>



<h3 id="3-make-your-online-banking-systems-speak-one-language">3. Make Your Online Banking Systems Speak One Language</h3>



<p><br>For most Baas clients, online self-service bots and contact centres are the only way to interact with a bank.</p>



<p>Therefore, it&#8217;s necessary to ensure there&#8217;s a connection between the contact centre and the other teams, data sources, and departments.</p>



<p>Contact centre operations typically thrive from the context derived from answering questions such as:</p>



<p>â€¢ What is the name of this client?<br>â€¢ Has the system properly authenticated the client?<br>â€¢ For how many years have they banked with the company?<br>â€¢ What products and digital payments services do they usually use?<br>â€¢ How can the contact centre solve their issue?</p>



<p>The data to answer these questions will come from the connections made through core system integration, authentication, and CRM segmentation.</p>



<p>To ensure the digital payments systems are speaking in one language, contact centre leaders will need to shift their focus to:</p>



<p>â€¢ Providing one platform where the teams can perform all tasks in a single environment<br>â€¢ Improved customer engagement through social media and mobile apps<br>â€¢ Try to boost productivity by encouraging automation</p>



<h3 id="4-allow-your-baas-clients-to-self-serv">4. Allow Your Baas Clients to Self Serve</h3>



<p>Today&#8217;s customers have become increasingly self-reliant. The digital payments services have conditioned them to find what they want when they want.</p>



<p>As a result, they have learned to yearn for such experiences. Some even expect to encounter them when using internet banking solutions.</p>



<p>Whether searching for a product or changing the account settings, customers find that having the ability to do so is convenient and efficient.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s particularly true when you look at the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the consumer banking industry.</p>



<p>The pandemic has limited in-branch and in-person service, forcing clients to adopt mobile and digital banking.<br>Allowing self-service is a great way to transform banking into service, as most credit unions and banks currently don&#8217;t support this option.</p>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>



<p>The current economy relies on digital payments. This means that all businesses should use electronic transactions to send and receive money from customers safely. The good news is that the concept of electronic funds transfer applies to businesses and customers. But both parties need to understand how it works to avoid scams.</p>



<p>The technology allows money to move fast, making businesses grow and promoting customer satisfaction. It is an essential part of the economy as it allows money to be transacted from person to person. This article will help you understand how electronic funds transfer works, why you should use it and the types available.</p>



<h2>What is Electronic Funds Transfer?</h2>



<p>What is EFT in banking? Electronic funds transfer can be described as payments done over an online network. It can be from one bank account to another bank account. For the payments to be completed, there must be two parties involved. That is the sender and the receiver. It is not a must for the accounts to be from the same financial services. Funds transfer will still happen even when both parties are using different accounts.</p>



<p>Another thing is that when using electronic banking, know that there is no need for paperwork. You can send money directly through an app, card reader, or computer. The good news is that the Electronic Funds Transfer ACT protects all people who use electronic banking. This ensures that all individuals safely transact through the electronic banking system.</p>



<h2>Advantages and Drawbacks of EFT.</h2>



<p>Like any other payment system, the wireless transfer comes with its pros and cons. Here are electronic funds transfer advantages and disadvantages you should know.</p>



<h3>Advantages of electronic fund transfer:</h3>



<p><strong>Merchants can access money Faster</strong>.</p>

It also reduces bank fees and saves time. Apart from that, customers can send money fast and receive what they have purchased within a few days.</p>



<p><strong>There is no need for a credit or debit card</strong>.</p>



<p>Many online businesses accept payments through electronic check conversion. This means you can complete a financial transaction without a card. The linked bank account will send the payment directly to the receiver.</p>



<p><strong>It is safe to receive money through EFT</strong>.</p>



<p>The electronic banking system is rapidly growing because of many online businesses. The problem is that so many fraudsters try to take advantage of businesses and customers. This has forced financial services to set strict transaction measures to ensure scams do not occur, making electronic banking safe to use. Some services like Verv provide their customers with a<a href="http://localhost:8080/how-multiple-payment-gateways-help-merchants-sell/#:~:text=Anyone%20looking%20to%20expand%20their%20business%20to%20a%20global%20scale%20should%20consider%20whether%20their%20current%20payment%20provider%20can%20handle%20such%20a%20shift." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> payment gateway</a> to make transactions flow smoothly.</p>



<h3>Drawbacks.</h3>



<p><strong>If you lose money, it may not be recovered</strong>.</p>



<p>If you lose your money during a wire transfer, it may be hard to trace who the recipient was. Funds may be sent to overseas accounts and withdrawn instantly by the receiver. When this happens, it will be impossible to get your funds back.</p>



<p><strong>Some EFTs fees are high</strong>.</p>



<p>Another disadvantage is some services charge high transaction fees. Several electronic funds transfer companies have different transaction fees. But some are very expensive. The good thing is that business owners always try to find affordable financial services for customers to use.</p>



<h2>How Electronic Funds Transfer Works.</h2>



<p>If you are wondering how to receive EFT payments, it is crucial to understand how electronic funds transfer works. It will help you know how to utilize the payment system. EFT transactions are usually made via a computer or phone using an internet connection. When using it, you do not have to deal with cash; all the transactions are mainly done through the exchange of data. This is what represents your money.</p>



<p>Most businesses use EFT to send and receive money. For the electronic fund transfer process to happen successfully, you must know the receiverâ€™s bank information and authorize the EFT payment. From there, the money will be sent to the receiver. The financial service you are using will deduct their set transaction fee. Then send the rest of the payments to the receiver.</p>
